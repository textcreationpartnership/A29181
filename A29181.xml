            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Parables of our Saviour being full of Excellent Inſtruction, and in a Familiar way teaching the Greateſt and moſt Neceſſary Truths; I thought it would be a very uſeful <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to Diſcourſe Practically upon them: And by <hi>explaining</hi> them, and enforcing the Senſe couch'd under them, to make them ſerviceable to the Great Ends for which they were deſign'd. The engaging Men in a Hearty Love and Obedience to our Great Maſter Jeſus, and in an Induſtrious Proviſion for the Happineſs of the other World.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed to conſider the Parables themſelves, I think 'twill be convenient to give a Brief Account, why our Saviour ſo often ſpake in that <hi>Myſtical</hi> Manner to his Hearers? And 'tis a Queſtion which his own Diſciples ask'd him, after he had deliver'd his firſt Parable of a <hi>Sower;</hi> they came unto him and ſaid, <hi>Why ſpeakeſt thou unto them in Parables?</hi> Matt. <hi>13.10.</hi> To this our Lord gives a double Anſwer in the 11th and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Verſes, thus. I ſpeak to the People in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <hi>becauſe it is given to you,</hi> that are true Believers and my Faithful Diſciples, <hi>to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> or of the Goſpel; <hi>but to them,</hi> that is, as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the 15th Verſe, <hi>whoſe Heart is waxed Groſs,</hi> or Obdurate and Obſtinate, <hi>and their Ears
<pb facs="tcp:103289:4"/>dull of Hearing, and who have cloſed,</hi> or will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhut <hi>their Eyes</hi> againſt the Light and Truth that I manifeſt to the World, <hi>leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their Eyes, and Hear with their Ears, and Underſtand with their Heart, and ſhould be Converted and I ſhould Heal them:</hi> To ſuch as theſe, as very <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthy of the Favour, <hi>it is not given</hi> to have the Myſteries of Religion <hi>plainly</hi> reveal'd to them but only <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically,</hi> and <hi>Covertly</hi> by way of <hi>Parable.</hi> That is, 'twas by way of <hi>Puniſhment</hi> for their Infidelity and Hardneſs of Heart, and Deſpiſing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting His former <hi>Plainer</hi> Diſcourſes on the Mount and in other Places; and their Averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to believe in him notwithſtanding the <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> he did, and Blaſphemous Attributing his caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a Devil from one poſſeſſed who was <hi>Blind</hi> and <hi>Dumb,</hi> to the Power of <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the Prince of the <hi>Devils:</hi> 'Twas by way of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for this strange <hi>Obduracy</hi> of theirs that he took upon him that more <hi>Obſcure</hi> way of Inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them than he before had uſed; and which new Practice of his, was a tacit Intimation of his <hi>Diſpleaſure</hi> against them, and did threaten a <hi>Total</hi> Concealment of thoſe Glad Tidings from them which he came to bring unto the World, if they perſisted in their Obſtinacy and Disbelief.</p>
            <p>And this is manifest from the whole of what St. <hi>Matthew</hi> records of our Lord's Diſcourſes <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> this 13th Chapter; which we find to be very <hi>Plain</hi> and expreſſed in the <hi>uſual</hi> manner, till the Phariſees with Helliſh Malice would diſparage the Great Miracle he wrought upon the <hi>poſſeſſed Man,</hi> by aſcribing it to <hi>Art-Magick</hi> and the Power of
<pb facs="tcp:103289:4"/>the <hi>Devil:</hi> And from <hi>that</hi> Time, after Confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Objection, and ſharply reproving their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs</hi> and great Obſtinacy, he very frequently expreſs'd himſelf by way of <hi>Parable</hi> in his publick Diſcourſes, and afterwards in private explained all to his Diſciples; and he gives this reaſon for his ſo doing, verſe <hi>12. For whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more Abundance; but whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken away even that he hath.</hi> That is, He that upon my former <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Open</hi> Inſtructions hath Believed and Obeyed me, ſhall have ſtill more and more as Plain Manifeſtations made to him of the Myſteries of the Goſpel: But he that hath made no Good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of what was then ſo <hi>clearly</hi> made known to him, but continu'd ſtill Faithleſs and Obſtinate, ſhall for the Future be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of that full Light and <hi>Sun-ſhine</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and be afforded only ſome Obſcurer <hi>Glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of it, and behold it as through a <hi>Veil.</hi> A Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment this, had they underſtood it, very Great; and which was enough to cure them of their <hi>Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs,</hi> and make them more ready to embrace that Heavenly Diſcipline before it was too <hi>Late;</hi> For that <hi>Eclipſe</hi> of that Glorious Light, was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fore-runner of that Eternal <hi>Night</hi> which was to follow, unleſs they ſpeedily Repented and Believ'd. And this ſhould be an Admonition to <hi>us</hi> likewiſe to Fear und Tremble and walk with the greateſt Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, lest we Fall after the ſame Example of <hi>Unbelief</hi> and Diſobedience; leſt we ſo long Reject that Light which is come into the World and prefer Darkneſs before it, as to become utterly unworthy of it, and it be quite hid from our Eyes, and outer Darkneſs at laſt become our Portion.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:103289:5"/>
            <p>This is <hi>one</hi> Reaſon our Lord gives of his ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the People in <hi>Parables;</hi> it was by way of <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> and as an Expreſſion of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure at their <hi>hardned Infidelity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is <hi>another,</hi> and that a very <hi>Merciful</hi> one, as reſpecting a ſort of People not <hi>Maliciouſly</hi> Faulty as thoſe before-mention'd, but chiefly to blame for <hi>Heedleſs Inadvertency;</hi> 'tis thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, <hi>v. 13.</hi> of this <hi>13.</hi> ch. <hi>Therefore ſpeak I to them in Parables, becauſe they ſeeing ſee not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</hi> That is, becauſe his Plainer and more Common Diſcourſes were but little regarded by them, and not <hi>conſider'd</hi> and <hi>attended</hi> to as they ſhould be, but forgotten as ſoon as heard; therefore the more to engage their <hi>Attention,</hi> and induce them to look <hi>cloſe</hi> into and <hi>dwell</hi> longer upon what he ſaid, he put his Diſcourſes into a more <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical</hi> and uncommon Dreſs; that their deſire of underſtanding his <hi>hidden</hi> Meaning, might employ more of their Thoughts about it, and put them upon making a further enquiry than otherwiſe they would do, and by that means his Doctrine make a deeper Impreſſion upon their Minds and Memories. For Men are naturally deſirous of finding out <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and <hi>Hidden</hi> Meanings, and more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Attentive to what is unuſual and out of the common road of talking, and will take <hi>Pains</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what is under the Diſguiſe of a <hi>Parable,</hi> and be much more pleaſed and affected with the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of ſuch a <hi>hidden Treaſure</hi> (to which our Lord elſewhere reſembles the Goſpel) than if the ſame thing had been offer'd them at an eaſier Rate. And accordingly St. <hi>Luke,</hi> after he had recorded ſeveral
<pb facs="tcp:103289:5"/>of our Saviour's <hi>Parables,</hi> ſubjoyns that all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were <hi>very Attentive to hear him;</hi> and no Doubt but they were as Inquiſitive to <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> what they had heard.</p>
            <p>And indeed, tho' this be a <hi>Myſtical</hi> way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and hath ſomething of <hi>Obſcurity</hi> in it, yet as it may be manag'd, nothing can be more <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar,</hi> or more ſuitable to the Capacities of the Meaneſt Auditors. For the vulgar ſort are but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Receptive of <hi>Abſtracted</hi> Notions, and Nice and Lofty Speculations; and <hi>that</hi> is moſt likely to take with <hi>them,</hi> which is cloathed in a Dreſs they have been well acquainted with, and Illuſtrated by ſome Material Repreſentation: For by this means, a Truth which otherwiſe deliver'd they would either not Apprehend, or not <hi>Conſider</hi> and Attend to; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſs'd by way of Reſemblance to what they have been much uſed to, and underſtand very well, is preſently entertain'd, and becomes Familiar and Eaſie to them, and they can as well remember and attend to it, as to other common Concerns of Life. And accordingly we find our Lord's Parables taken either from ſome common and known <hi>Actions of Men,</hi> ſuch as of <hi>a Husband-man ſowing Corn in his Field, and the ſpringing up of Weeds with the good Corn,</hi> of a <hi>Fiſher throwing his Net into the Sea,</hi> of the <hi>looking for a loſt Sheep,</hi> and the <hi>Extravagancies and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a Prodigal Son,</hi> and the like; or from ſome common <hi>Accidents</hi> and <hi>Events</hi> that are taken notice of in the World, ſuch as of a <hi>Treaſure found that was hid in a Field, the Plentiful Product of a Man's Ground,</hi> the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfruitfulneſs of a Tree, the <hi>Reckoning of a Maſter with his
<pb facs="tcp:103289:6"/>Servants, the Importunacy of a Poor Widow for Juſtice,</hi> and ſuch like. Relations of this nature are eaſily <hi>Remembred,</hi> and People are naturally apt to <hi>liſten</hi> and <hi>attend</hi> to them, and the meaneſt Capacity can <hi>underſtand</hi> and <hi>apprehend</hi> them, and if well manag'd, they make what is repeſented by them appear very <hi>Lively</hi> and <hi>Affecting,</hi> as if 'twere <hi>Acted</hi> before our Eyes; and by this means the Truths deliver'd under that Diſguiſe inſenſibly Inſinuate themſelves, and work upon the Mind even before a Man is aware of it, or can ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to make Reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>And as theſe Parables of our Lord were drawn from the most <hi>Familiar</hi> things, they were ſo <hi>Apt</hi> likewiſe, and ſo excellently <hi>Manag'd,</hi> and there was ſo great Analogy between the things repreſented and the Repreſentations of them, that a little <hi>Thought</hi> and <hi>Reflection</hi> of even an ordinary <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, would diſcover what was hid under ſo thin a Veil: And accordingly we find ſeveral of our Saviour's Parables taken preſently by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors in their true and naked meaning, and no doubt but more were ſo than the Evangeliſts took notice of. But leaſt they ſhould not be apprehended, we find our Lord, when in Private, explaining them to his Diſciples, and giving them command to <hi>ſpeak in the Light what he told them in Darkneſs;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 10.27.</note> and by this means, that Impreſſion which the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble made upon the <hi>Fancy</hi> and <hi>Imagination</hi> of the People at the first relation of it, would afterwards either by Mens own Interpretation, or the Apoſtles, have its due effect upon their <hi>Underſtandings, Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides this General <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs of Parables,
<pb facs="tcp:103289:6"/>there is one thing they are more peculiarly proper for, and that is <hi>Reproof;</hi> which is a thing Men are moſt of all Impatient of, and that muſt be manag'd with great <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Nicety,</hi> or it will do much more Harm than Good. If it be too Plain and Open and Severe, it often <hi>Hardens</hi> an Offender ſtill more; and if it be too Cool and Lifeleſs, it loſes its Force and makes no Impreſſion.</p>
            <p>In an Effectual Reproof then, there muſt be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Smartneſs,</hi> and likewiſe ſo much <hi>Privacy</hi> and <hi>Secrecy</hi> in it, as may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate the Man too much from a Sence of the great Shame and Ignominy that attends the laying <hi>Open</hi> his Faults to the World. Now Reproving by way of Parable does all this. There may be Strength and Smartneſs enough in it if it be well choſen and applied; and yet there is ſo much of a Diſguiſe and Covering upon it, as makes it very Private, and not to grate ſo much upon that Tender Paſſion of <hi>Shame,</hi> as a more publick and barefac'd Reproof would do. 'Tis, as one handſomly expreſſes it, like Lancing a Sore with the Lancet <hi>wrapt up in a Sponge;</hi> when under Pretence and Shew of nothing but ſmooth and gentle <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage, the place is unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly open'd and the Corruption let out; which the Patient would not have ſuffer'd to be done, if attempted Roughly and without that Stratagem. And there is a notable Inſtance of this Parabolical way of Reproving, mention'd <hi>2 Sam. 12.</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Murder of <hi>Uriah,</hi> that he might enjoy his Wife without Diſturbance, the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> was ſent to Reprove him for it, and denounce God's Great Diſpleaſure againſt him: And that he might do this the more effectually, did not Flatly and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb facs="tcp:103289:7"/>tell him of his great Wickedneſs, but frames a Parable of a Rich Man that had great Flocks and Herds of his own, who yet to entertain his Gueſt, took the <hi>Only little Ewe Lamb</hi> of a <hi>Poor Neighbour</hi> of his, which he had bought and nouriſh'd up with great Tenderneſs and Pleaſure; and dreſs'd it for the Man that was come to him. <hi>And</hi> David<hi>'s Anger,</hi> the Story ſays, <hi>was greatly kindled againſt the Man, and he ſaid unto</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, <hi>as the Lord liveth the Man that hath done this thing ſhall ſurely die, and ſhall reſtore the Lamb Four-fold, becauſe he did this thing, and becauſe he had no Pity.</hi> When the Prophet ſaw that his Deſign had ſo far taken effect, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately follows his Blow, takes Advantage of the Kings Diſpleaſure, and makes the Application home, <hi>Thou art the Man.</hi> And this Myſtical Reproof ſtruck <hi>David</hi> ſo deep, that without making any Excuſes, he preſently confeſſes his Guilt, that he had ſinned againſt the Lord; when 'tis very likely a Rougher and more Downright Reprimand would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated the King into Rage and Impatience at his being ſo expos'd by the Prophet, rather than have melted him into ſo humble and pungent a Remorſe as this.</p>
            <p>This Courſe then our Lord took, not without great Wiſdom; and by Parables apt and well choſen and very expreſſive of his Meaning, reproved the Obſtinacy, Hypocriſie, and other Vices of the Jews, who were Men Stubborn and Refractory, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of too open a Rebuke: Eſpecially the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> whoſe <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Haughtineſs,</hi> and great Repute with the People, made them not able to endure any thing of <hi>Reproof,</hi> tho wrap'd up in the Diſguiſe
<pb facs="tcp:103289:7"/>of a <hi>Parable,</hi> much leſs when publick and open, and in plainer Terms. Tho' as to the Phariſees, when this milder way would not do, he more plainly and ſharply rebuk'd and expos'd their Great Wickedneſs and Vile Hypocriſie.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Reaſons why our Lord ſpake ſo much in <hi>Parables;</hi> and twas a Courſe which many of the Greateſt and Wiſeſt Men had taken before him. The Prophets in the Old Teſtament, and ſeveral of the Heathens, expreſs'd their Inſtructions and Reproofs in ſuch a Myſtical manner, and by way of <hi>Fable</hi> or feigned Relation of ſome Action or Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence that bore Reſemblance to what they would Inculcate; as is very evident to ſuch as Converſe with their Writings. Which Courſe, had it not been very Effectual to the Ends for which it was deſign'd, it would not have been ſo much in Reputation as it was; and if it was ſo effectual then, why may it not be ſo ſtill; if not to frame <hi>new Parables,</hi> yet to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate and inforce the Old? Eſpecially thoſe which our Lord, with admirable Wiſdom and Judgment, made uſe of to reprove Vice by, and encourage a Sincere and Perſevering Piety?</p>
            <p>The Truths that are couch'd under theſe <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Expreſſions,</hi> are of the greateſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſuch as it nearly concerns us to <hi>attend to,</hi> and Practice accordingly; and the manner of <hi>expreſſing</hi> them is ſuch, as illuſtrates with great Advantage, and very movingly recommends them, and that in ſuch a <hi>Familiar</hi> way, as fits them to all Capacities tho' never ſo Indifferent; and may be of great uſe to work upon the meaner ſort, who I fear are too little apprehenſive of what is deliver'd in more Abſtracted Terms.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:103289:8"/>
            <p>I have therefore Practically conſider'd the moſt, and moſt uſeful of our Saviour's <hi>Parables,</hi> paſſing by thoſe only that wholly relate to the Jews, and that Infant State of the Goſpel, and can't without <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> be made Serviceable to the Improvement of Religion amongſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> eſpecially <hi>now</hi> at this Diſtance from the Times wherein they were ſpoken. But of this ſort there are but Three or Four; and the reſt that are not Particularly Diſcourſed of, are <hi>Co-incident</hi> and of the ſame <hi>Senſe</hi> with thoſe that are. And I hope this may not be an <hi>Unprofitable</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking <hi>thro' his Bleſſing who Alone can give the Increaſe;</hi> to Advance whoſe Honour in promoting the Good of Souls they are made Publick.</p>
            <p>I deſire only that two things may be further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd: The one is, That theſe Diſcourſes are on Purpoſe deſign'd to be <hi>Purely Practical,</hi> as I have ſtil'd them in the Title Page, and as every Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reader will diſcern, when he finds me wave many Fair Opportunities of Controverſie that lie in my way; and my Reaſon for ſo doing, I think, is very ſufficient, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Becauſe 'tis too Obſervable that the great Defect of Chriſtians now-a-days is in their <hi>Practice,</hi> which yet is the <hi>One thing Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</hi> The other is, that, According to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Advice of
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>More Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vochim</hi> in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</note> 
               <hi>Maimonides,</hi> the Reader expect not <hi>(Rationem &amp; Explicationem omnium ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borum &amp; rerum in Parabola Contentarum ad Rem Significatum,</hi> &amp;c.) <q>a Minute and Particular Application of every Word and Thing in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, to the Senſe that is couch'd under it; but be contented with a more General Explication of the <hi>Sum</hi> and <hi>Scope</hi> of it. For otherwiſe either the main Intention of the Parable will be quite
<pb facs="tcp:103289:8"/>loſt, or at leaſt the Mind will be tir'd in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after an Explication of what cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd; and nothing be the Reſult of ſuch Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Study, but that Empty Vexatious Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, which all thoſe Experience, who make it their endeavour to find out, or rather force from the Words of an Author, that which the Author himſelf never ſo much as dream'd of. All therefore that a Man ſhould propoſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Explication of the greateſt part of any Parable, is to find out what is the main Drift and Deſign of it; and what it is which the Author of it would Inſtruct Men in, by that Allegorical Scheme of Speech.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But tho' this be Excellent Advice, and I have endeavour'd to obſerve it in the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; yet, where it could be done without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Straining and <hi>Violence,</hi> I have been very <hi>Particular</hi> in my Explication: And indeed, moſt of our Saviour's Parables are ſo aptly expreſs'd in the Parts as well as in the Whole, that they not only will Bear but Require a Minute Application of the Allegory to that which is repreſented by it, and which receives a great Advantage from it; as may be obſerv'd in the Peruſal of what is now offer'd to the Reader's View.</p>

            <p>THIS Parable is very fitly placed <hi>firſt,</hi> as giving Account of the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of Mens Fruitfulneſs or Unfruitfulneſs in Chriſtianity; and conſequently, ſhews what is to be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,</hi> and directs to what is to be <hi>done,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:103289:10"/>in order to Men's being <hi>better'd</hi> by the Sermons of the Goſpel: Which is a thing <hi>firſt</hi> of all to be taken notice of, by ſuch as would be <hi>Chriſtians endeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Lord's <hi>Interpretation</hi> of this Parable,
<note place="margin">Matth. 13.19. Mark 4.14. Luk. 8.11.</note> from a Collation of the Three Evangeliſts that record it, is this:</p>
            <p>The <hi>Seed</hi> is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> or the Word of the Kingdom; that is, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, the Religion that Chriſt Jeſus came to teach the World. When any one hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this Word, and <hi>underſtandeth</hi> it not, then cometh the wicked one or Satan im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and catcheth away that which was ſown in his Heart, leſt he ſhould <hi>believe</hi> and be <hi>ſav'd;</hi> this is he who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Seed by <hi>the Way-ſide.</hi> But he that receiv'd the Seed into <hi>rocky</hi> or Stony Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is he that heareth the Word and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently with <hi>Joy</hi> receiveth it, yet hath not <hi>Root</hi> in himſelf, and ſo endures or believes but for <hi>a while;</hi> for when <hi>Tribulation or Perſecution</hi> ariſeth becauſe of the Word, he is ſoon offended or diſcouraged, and falls away in Time of Temptation. He alſo that receiv'd Seed among the <hi>Thorns,</hi> is he that heareth the Word, and goeth forth, and the <hi>Cares</hi> of <hi>this</hi> World, and the Deceitfulneſs of <hi>Riches,</hi> and the <hi>Luſts</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of this Life entring in, <hi>choak</hi> the Word, and it becometh <hi>Unfruitful,</hi> or at beſt bringeth no Fruit to <hi>Perfection.</hi> But, He that received Seed into the <hi>good Ground,</hi> is he that having heard the Word, <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth</hi>

            <p>From the Parable thus interpreted by its Divine Author, it appears, as was ſaid, that the Deſign of it is to ſhew what are the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of Men's improving or not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving under the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; that ſo we may know what to <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void</hi> and what to <hi>embrace</hi> and <hi>endeavour after</hi> in order to our being <hi>fruitful</hi> under thoſe Means of Inſtruction we enjoy.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now conſider each Part of this Parable with its Interpretation.</p>
            <p>The Firſt is, <hi>Behold, a Sower went forth to ſow: And when he ſowed, ſome Seeds fell by the Wayes-ſide and were trodden down, and the Fowls of the Air came and devour'd them up:</hi> The Interpretation is, that the <hi>Seed</hi> which is ſown is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and when any one heareth this Word and <hi>underſtandeth</hi> it not, then cometh the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> or the wicked one immediately, and catcheth away that which was ſown in his Heart, leſt he ſhould believe and be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This is he that receiv'd Seed by the Way-ſide, or this is that Seed which fell by the Way-ſide.</p>
            <p>The Word of God is compared to <hi>Seed,</hi> becauſe of its <hi>fructifying,</hi> growing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing Nature; becauſe it hath in it an <hi>Active</hi> Principle, and will when ſown,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103289:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>(unleſs kill'd and made unfruitful by Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Injuries) ſpring up into excellent Fruits and in great Abundance, to the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the nouriſhing, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening, nav the <hi>immortalizing</hi> of <hi>Men;</hi> for of this Divine <hi>Seed</hi> conſiſts that Heavenly <hi>Bread, which whoſo eateth of ſhall live for ever.</hi> 'Tis this Seed that bringeth forth thoſe Graces of Chriſtianity, which keep up the <hi>Divine Life</hi> in the Soul; 'tis this that makes it grow in Grace and in the Knowledg and Love of the beſt and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt of Objects, our <hi>Lord Jeſus;</hi> 'tis this that is its Preparation for Heaven, and an Earneſt of that Immortal and Glorious Inheritance. For, whereſoever that Seed is ſown,
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.22.</note> and ſprings up, and <hi>brings forth Fruit unto Holineſs, the End</hi> moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>will be Everlaſting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Word of God, is not only, for theſe Reaſons, compared to <hi>Seed,</hi> but to Seed <hi>ſown:</hi> 'Tis not only <hi>potentially</hi> fruitful, but the Powers of it are now call'd forth into <hi>Act;</hi> 'tis <hi>actually ſown,</hi> the Goſpel is preach'd and made known to the World, its excellent Precepts are <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> declar'd, and <hi>planted</hi> in Men's <hi>Hearts,</hi> by the Propoſal of infinite Rewards and Puniſhments to ſuch as <hi>do</hi> or do <hi>not</hi> obey and practiſe them. And, this Seed thus ſown, is <hi>water'd</hi> with the Dews of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with the Diſtillations of the Divine Grace and Bleſſing, which are in ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Plenty afforded to every Man; ſo
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103289:11"/>that God, the great <hi>Husbandman,</hi> is not wanting in any thing that is neceſſary to the Flouriſhing and Encreaſe of that Seed, which he hath thus committed to their Hearts: And therefore he expects (and 'tis but reaſonable he ſhould) to ſee it grow and bring forth Fruit where'ere 'tis plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; wherever the Word is preach'd he expects the Fruit of Righteouſneſs. The Seed is good, and moſt of all <hi>agreeable</hi> to the <hi>Soil</hi> wherein 'tis ſown (for <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is the beſt <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and therefore moſt <hi>natural</hi> to a <hi>reaſonable Soul)</hi> and 'tis ſown in great <hi>Plenty;</hi> there is no Scarcity of God's Word among us, and 'tis water'd ſufficiently with the Dew of Heaven, the Grace of God, which is not wanting to any Man that will receive it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at our Peril we muſt all be <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi> none of us muſt appear before our great Lord <hi>empty,</hi> leſt the Puniſhment of <hi>Barrenneſs</hi> be our Portion, and we be burnt up with <hi>unquenchable Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Seed then, or the Word of God, being thus <hi>actually ſown,</hi> the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion planted in the World, and all things done on <hi>God's</hi> Part, in order to its being <hi>fruitful,</hi> and which accordingly he expects it <hi>ſhould</hi> be; it highly concerns <hi>us,</hi> in the next Place, to take care that it <hi>be</hi> ſo, and that nothing make it otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>That is, that, in the Firſt Place, it be not like Seed ſown or ſcatter'd by the <hi>Way Side,</hi> which is trodden down by the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103289:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>Feet of Men and Beaſts, or devoured by the Fowls of the Air. We muſt not be thought leſs and <hi>inconſiderate</hi> after we have heard the Word, and ſuffer our Souls to be like a <hi>High-way,</hi> laid open and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>all Comers,</hi> to all Sorts of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, uſeleſs and wicked Thoughts, which thronging in Abundance, will tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple down the Good Seed that was ſown, that it ſhall never more appear, be no more thought of or remembred by us. Nor muſt we leave it to the Mercy of the <hi>Fowls of the Air,</hi> the Devil and his Legions, who, like Birds of Prey, hover over us continually, and are always ready to catch away immediately thoſe good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions inſtill'd into our Minds, leſt they ſhould grow into Faith and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and which they ſee lye ſcattered and unregarded by us, and <hi>unobſerved,</hi> throw in their Places, the Seeds of Sin and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, which, like ill Weeds, will flouriſh any where and grow apace. Thus <hi>heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> of ſo great a Treaſure muſt we by no means be, but by <hi>Recollection</hi> of Thought, advert cloſely to the great Truths of the Goſpel, and exclude all wandring and vain Imaginations, and carefully gather up thoſe Notions of Religion which lie ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in our Minds, and reduce them to ſome Order and Connexion, and infix them by Meditation ſtill <hi>deeper</hi> in our Souls; and inſtead of a dry, barren and <hi>common Way,</hi> for all Temptations and Injections of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103289:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>Devil, for numerous and vain and incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Phancies, we ſhould by ſerious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to thoſe concerning Truths, that we have read or heard, make our Souls (as <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſſes it) <hi>a Garden enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, a Spring ſhut up,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cant. 4.12.</note> and <hi>a Fountain ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> And then no Fear of the Seeds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trodden down or devour'd by the Fowls of the Air; but 'twill remain <hi>rooted</hi> and grounded in our Hearts, and <hi>will bring forth its Fruit in its Seaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, We muſt take care that the Word be not like Seed ſown in <hi>ſtony</hi> and <hi>rocky</hi> Places, where there is no <hi>Deepneſs of Earth;</hi> leſt, it ſpring up too <hi>haſtily,</hi> and when the Sun is hot it be ſcorch'd and wither away becauſe it hath no <hi>Root.</hi> That is, as our Lord interprets it, we muſt be carefull not only to <hi>receive</hi> the Word with Joy, and have an <hi>extempore</hi> ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Religion, and <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> only for a <hi>while;</hi> but likewiſe to <hi>endure,</hi> and not be offended or diſcouraged though Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or Perſecution ariſe becauſe of the Word, nor to fall away in Time of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>I doubt there are too many of theſe <hi>Rocky</hi> Hearers, that perhaps are well enough pleas'd to be handſomſely told of their Duty, to hear a well-pen'd Sermon, and for the preſent readily aſſent to the Truth and Reaſonableneſs of what is diſcours'd to them; and believe it their Intereſt to live as becomes Chriſtians, and rejoyce
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103289:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>at the News of being freeed from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the Devil and their own unruly Luſts and Paſſions, <hi>of being made Children and Heirs of God,</hi> and <hi>Coheirs with Chriſt of an Eternal Inheritance,</hi> and that there are never-fading Crowns of Glory reſerv'd for them in the higheſt Heavens; and are reſolved to ſet about the Performance of that Duty immediately, which is ſo excellent in it ſelf and ſhall be ſo infinitely rewarded. And indeed, the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is ſo highly reaſonable in its own Nature, ſo conducive to the Comfort and Happineſs even of <hi>this</hi> Life, and the ſure Way to ſuch endleſs Bliſs hereafter, that it can't but be very pleaſing in the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory,</hi> to any Man of Senſe and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>But after all this, I fear there are too many Hearers, that like <hi>Rocky</hi> Places, have only a <hi>Surface</hi> of good Earth, and retain this good Affection to Religion but for a <hi>while,</hi> and at the Bottom are impenetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as a Rock, and will not ſuffer the good Seed to ſhoot ſo <hi>deep</hi> into their Hearts, and take ſo <hi>firm</hi> a Rooting as is neceſſary to its Fruitfulneſs and Increaſe.</p>
            <p>Their Spring is quickly over, a <hi>Blade</hi> or a <hi>Stalk</hi> is the fartheſt Progreſs their Religion makes, and never arrives to the <hi>full Corn in the Ear;</hi> but when they meet with any Difficulty in the Practice of it in it ſelf, or any Oppoſition to it either <hi>without</hi> from <hi>Men,</hi> or from the Devils Temptations <hi>within;</hi> For want of Deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103289:13"/>of Earth and Moiſture they fall and wither away. If there were nothing elſe for 'em to do but to <hi>receive</hi> the Promiſes, they would with Joy indeed give ear to the glorious Deſcriptions of the Happineſs of a Chriſtian: Nay, that Happineſs is ſo exceeding great, that <hi>at preſent</hi> they may very well be glad to hear of the <hi>Way</hi> to attain it, and for a ſpurt ſet chearfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and a ſhallow <hi>Cruſt</hi> of Earth will be ſufficient to make ſome Shew and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi> of Fruitfulneſs and Increaſe. But, unleſs the Heart be <hi>throughly</hi> plyable, and there be <hi>Deepneſs</hi> of Earth, an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Senſe of the great Need we have that this Divine Seed ſhould take Root and grow up in our Souls, and likewiſe the <hi>Moiſture</hi> of a ſincere <hi>Repentance</hi> for our former Barrenneſs and ſtony Hardneſs of Heart, the Word will take but ſhallow Rooting for all our ſuddain Raptures, and upon upon every Difficulty and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be ready to languiſh and wither, eſpecially when the Heats of Perſecution ſtrike upon it; and then, too often, the latter End is worſe than the Beginning, and the Men grow more hardned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible than ever.</p>
            <p>Thoſe therefore that find themſelves of this <hi>rocky</hi> Temper, ſo difficult to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to be Chriſtians indeed, ſo ready to look upon the <hi>ſmooth</hi> Side of Religion only, and pleaſe themſelves in the <hi>Theory</hi> of it, admire the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103289:14"/>but find <hi>great Reſiſtance</hi> in their Breaſts when the Word would take <hi>deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Root,</hi> and they are exhorted to a ſtill more and more excellent and fruitful Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety: Theſe Perſons are by all means to endeavour ſtill more and more to <hi>ſoften</hi> their Hearts, and make them <hi>pliable</hi> to the Impreſſions of the Word of Life; that it may ſink <hi>deep</hi> into their Souls, and be fix'd there beyond the Danger of yeilding to every Temptation, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering when Adverſity ſhall come. They muſt not boggle at any thing that appears to be their Duty, but be diligent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in ridding their Minds of their former Evil Habits and Inclinations, and <hi>inure</hi> themſelves to the Obedience of Chriſt; not pretending Hardſhip or Impoſſibility when <hi>He commands,</hi> not endeavouring to <hi>leſſen</hi> the Obligation of any of his Precepts, or ſhifting it from themſelves, nor expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heaven upon eaſier Terms: But, <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> their Lord's Will, endeavour to <hi>do</hi> it in Sincerity, upon ſuch Obedience on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, through the Merits of Chriſt, hoping for the Promiſes.</p>
            <p>And this Courſe, like good <hi>Tillage</hi> and <hi>Manuring</hi> of our Ground, will ſoon mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify the Heart, and make it not only <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially,</hi> but <hi>intirely Plyable</hi> to the Word of God, receptive of its Impreſſions to the very <hi>Bottom,</hi> ſo that it ſhall <hi>dwell in us richly,</hi> and bring forth Fruit, not only in Times of Security and <hi>Peace,</hi> but even
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103289:14"/>then when <hi>Tribulation</hi> ſhall ariſe becauſe of the Word, and take ſtill deeper Root, and bring forth greater Abundance, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Storms and Scorchings of Perſecution, or even a <hi>fiery Tryal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, in order to the Fruitfulneſs of the Word, we muſt be very careful that it be not like Seed that falleth among <hi>Thorns,</hi> leſt the Thorns ſpring up and choak it, ſo that it yield no Fruit. That is, that after the hearing of the Word we go not forth and ſuffer the <hi>Cares</hi> of <hi>this World,</hi> and the Deceitfulneſs of <hi>Riches,</hi> and the <hi>Luſts</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of this Life to enter in and choak the Word, and it become utterly <hi>unfruitful,</hi> or at leaſt, bring no Fruit to Perfection.</p>
            <p>'Tis by a lamentable Experience, too true, that the Love of <hi>this</hi> World very much hinders our Proviſion for the <hi>next;</hi> and 'tis <hi>as</hi> true, that this is the greateſt <hi>Folly and Madneſs</hi> in Nature, becauſe the <hi>World to come</hi> is upon all Accounts, ſo infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be preferr'd before the <hi>preſent,</hi> that there cannot be the leaſt Competition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them: For, how can a World of <hi>Cares and Vexations, of Miſery and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Sorts, of Hazards and Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of Sickneſs, Pain and Death,</hi> as <hi>this</hi> is, compare with a World of <hi>eternal, unmix'd and uninterrupted Happineſs,</hi> as is the <hi>other.</hi> And therefore, one would think Men ſhould be ſo <hi>wiſe</hi> and ſo much their <hi>own Friends,</hi> as to beſtow their greateſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103289:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>in Purſuit of their main Intereſt; and not on the contrary ſuch egregious Fools, as for the Gain of an <hi>empty Bubble</hi> to forfeit an <hi>happy Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So far as is conſiſtent with the Care of the <hi>Soul,</hi> 'tis very allowable to mind the Affairs of <hi>this Life:</hi> Nay, 'tis a <hi>Duty</hi> of our Holy Religion for every man to be induſtrious in his Calling, and to enjoy with Thankſgiving the Portion that God hath given him here below: But to <hi>invert</hi> God's Order, and place that Firſt in our Eſteem which ſhould be <hi>Laſt;</hi> when he ſays, ſeek ye <hi>Firſt</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and then all <hi>needful</hi> things of <hi>this</hi> World ſhall be added unto you, to run quite counter, and <hi>Firſt</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for Abundance <hi>here,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> (and that but very coldly, God knows) think a little of the <hi>Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs;</hi> this is ſuch a prepoſterous Courſe as can never end in any thing but <hi>Shame and Confuſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be true, that the Gain of even the <hi>whole World</hi> would be a very unprofitable Exchange when compared with the <hi>Loſs of the Soul;</hi> and if it be true, that the Loſs of the Soul will follow upon the Unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Word of God, for Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone will not ſave, but muſt bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit: And finally, if it be true, that a too great Love and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Proſecution of the things of this World will choak the Word of God; and make
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103289:15"/>it unfruitful, as our Lord in this Part of the Parable affirms it will: If all this be true, I ſee not how it can be avoided, but that ſuch as have a Deſire that the Word of God ſhould be fruitful in their Souls in order to the eternal <hi>Salvation</hi> of them, muſt love the World <hi>leſs,</hi> and their Souls <hi>more</hi> muſt be careful in the <hi>Firſt</hi> place to <hi>grow in Grace and be rich towards God,</hi> and clear their Minds of theſe worldly Thorns and Briars, leſt the Divine Life be ſtifled and that Seed choak'd which alone can fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy to a happy Immortality. We muſt <hi>uſe</hi> this World, yet ſo as not to <hi>abuſe</hi> it; but certainly he <hi>abuſes</hi> it and all the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that God affords him in it, who ſo immoderately <hi>Doats</hi> upon it, as to prefer it before the Service of his great <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,</hi> and ſpends moſt of his Thoughts and Endeavours about the encreaſing Wealth, and the Enjoyment of theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary Pleaſures, and can ſpare but very little, if any of his Time and Pains, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf for the Enjoyment of God in Glory.</p>
            <p>And yet, as plain as this is, Men are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſo little affected with it, as not only to neglect Religion as much as ever, and love the World ſtill more and more; but even to plead the <hi>Cares</hi> of the World as an <hi>Excuſe</hi> for their Coolneſs in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the Unfruitfulneſs of the Word of God in their Souls. We would be oftner at the Sacrament, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103289:16"/>in at the Prayers of the Church, and in reading and meditating upon the Holy Scriptures, but that the Cares of the World and the Hurry of Buſineſs takes up moſt of our Time and Thoughts. But for God's Sake, let ſuch conſider; is that an <hi>Excuſe,</hi> which is it <hi>ſelf</hi> as great a <hi>Fault</hi> as any? Will God accept ſuch an Excuſe at the Day of Judgment? Has he not plainly forewarn'd us of the Danger of too much worldly Mindedneſs? Has not St. <hi>John</hi> ſaid plainly,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.15.</note> 
               <hi>love not the World nor the things of the World, for whoſo loveth the World the Love of the Father is not in him:</hi> And our Lord as plainly, <hi>ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerve God and Mammon?</hi> How ſtrange a Plea then is it for the Neglect of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to ſay we are deeply engag'd in the Perſuit of <hi>this</hi> World's Good!</p>
            <p>If we believe we have Souls to be ſaved, methinks we ſhould take care of <hi>them</hi> in the <hi>Firſt</hi> place; and as for <hi>this</hi> World, a <hi>moderate</hi> Induſtry, ſuch as does by no means intrench upon Religion, is all that can be juſtifyed. And what our Lord ſaid to the Scribes and Phariſees about their taking care of leſſer Matters and neglecting the <hi>weighty</hi> things of the Law, ſhould be our Rule in providing for our Families, and providing for our Souls. <hi>Theſe things ought ye to have done, and not to have left the other undone.</hi> He that provides not for his own Houſe, according to the Meaſures of Neceſſity and Moderation, is worſe than
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103289:16"/>an Infidel, 'tis true; but he that provides not for his own <hi>Soul</hi> is ſtill more unnaturaly cruel.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the things that our Bleſſed Lord ſays make this Heavenly Seed, the Word of God, <hi>unfruitful;</hi> and therefore thoſe ſhould with the greateſt Care and Application poſſible, be provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt; nothing being of ſo great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to us as the Flouriſhing and Encreaſe of the Word of God.</p>
            <p>I come now to conſider the laſt Part of this Parable, <hi>viz.</hi> what it is that will make this holy Seed to <hi>thrive</hi> and bring forth plentifully the Fruits of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and which Courſe conſequently, it highly concerns us all to take, that we may not be barren under the Means of Inſtruction that we enjoy.</p>
            <p>Our Lord expreſſeth it thus: <hi>But, other Seed fell into good Ground, and brought forth Fruit, ſome an Hundred-Fold, ſome Sixty and ſome Thirty.</hi> That is, he that receiv'd Seed into the <hi>good</hi> Ground, is he that having heard the Word <hi>underſtandeth it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives and keeps it in an honeſt and good Heart, and brings forth Fruit with Patience according to his Ability, whether Thirty, Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or an Hundred-Fold.</hi> In this Part of the Parable there are <hi>Five</hi> things to be conſider'd.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the <hi>good Ground</hi> in which the Seed of the Word will take deep Root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bring forth Plentifully is an honeſt and good Heart.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:103289:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Secondly, That that which <hi>infixes</hi> the Seed of the Word in this good Ground, is <hi>Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> tranſlated <hi>underſtanding the Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the Seed ſo planted in this good Ground, muſt be diligently <hi>kept</hi> and <hi>preſerved</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That we muſt expect the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of it with <hi>Patience,</hi> and take care that the Fruits come to <hi>Perfection;</hi> and</p>
            <p>Laſtly, That this Increaſe muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the <hi>Quantity</hi> of the Seed that is ſown, and to the Strength and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the <hi>Soil</hi> in which it is ſown; that is, to every Man's <hi>Ability,</hi> and the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities he has had of Improvement, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Thirty, Sixty, or an Hundred-Fold.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The <hi>good Ground,</hi> in which the Seed of the Word will take deep Root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bring forth plentifully, is an <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and good Heart;</hi> that is, a Heart ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely deſirous to be <hi>inform'd</hi> in its Duty, and that cordially <hi>propoſes</hi> to <hi>perform</hi> it, and is truly <hi>humble</hi> and of a <hi>modeſt teachable</hi> Temper.</p>
            <p>St.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> tell us, that <hi>though he plants and</hi> Apollos <hi>water, yet 'tis God alone that giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Increaſe:</hi> Now, can any Man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin that God will make that effectual to our Good which we deſpiſe and value not, and force thoſe Favours upon us, which we neither now <hi>deſire,</hi> nor if we had them ſhould do other than <hi>neglect?</hi> The Graces of Religion are too precious to be beſtow'd upon ſuch brutiſh Natures, and none but thoſe that have Hearts earneſtly

               <hi>deſirous</hi> of his Divine Aſſiſtance, that they may be purifyed and renewed by his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit, and inſtructed in his holy Will that they may know how to pay a more acceptable Service to him; none but thoſe that have ſuch <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Hearts can expect the Word ſhould flouriſh and grow fruitful, and they only that thus <hi>hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs</hi> ſhall be <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this thoſe would do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, who frequent our religious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in complyance to Cuſtom only, and becauſe their Neighbours do; or to learn new <hi>Modes</hi> and Dreſſes, or to ſhew their <hi>own;</hi> or to while away the Time that lies uſeleſs upon their Hands, or to meet a Friend, or pleaſe their Ears with ſome new Notion, or to gratify their Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the like: Let not ſuch Perſons be deceiv'd, God is not mock'd; let not ſuch think they ſhall receive any thing of God but the Fierceneſs of his Diſpleaſure, for their prophaning to ſuch vile Purpoſes what he intends as a Means to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Thoſe only ſhall receive <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> by God's Word, that ſincerely and earneſtly deſire its <hi>Nouriſhment that they may grow thereby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>honeſt and good Heart,</hi> is likewiſe <hi>Modeſt</hi> and <hi>Teachable;</hi> and indeed, this Diſpoſition is very neceſſary in order to the Fruitfulneſs of the Word.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:103289:18"/>
            <p>For, Pride and Conceitedneſs are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the greateſt Hinderers of Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all Sorts of Acquirements what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; but in Religion they do the moſt Miſchief of all, and are the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers of whatever is religious and good.</p>
            <p>For, beſides that a high Opinion of ones own preſent Endowments cuts off all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of growing better, and renders all ſpiritual Advice <hi>barren</hi> to him that thinks he hath no need of it: Beſides, that <hi>Reproof</hi> frets and inrages one that thinks <hi>Commendations</hi> rather belong to <hi>him;</hi> and Inſtruction, in Caſes of Difficulty, is thrown away upon a Man that thinks himſelf Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than his Teachers: Beſides theſe and ſeveral other <hi>Natural</hi> Ill Conſequences of an over-weening Opinion of ones ſelf, which might be mentioned, there is this yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, that it utterly bars and ſhuts out God's holy Spirit; it deprives the Soul of his gracious Influences, and diverts the Streams of his Grace and Benediction from watering our Hearts:
<note place="margin">Prov. 16.5.</note> For <hi>Pride is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination unto the Lord,</hi> a thing that he hates and deteſts above all things: And St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, that inſtead of <hi>aſſiſting,</hi> God <hi>reſiſts the Proud,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 4.7.</note> is his profeſs'd E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. And no wonder if that Soul be barren, which is thus <hi>curſed of God,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed thoſe refreſhing Dews of his Favour which alone can make it fruitful. Let us therefore lay our Foundation <hi>low</hi> in <hi>Modeſty, Sincerity and Humility,</hi> and God will build
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103289:18"/>us up to Life everlaſting.

            <p>Secondly, that which infixes the Seed of the Word in the good Ground of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and good Heart, is <hi>Conſideration</hi> and <hi>Meditation,</hi> render'd in our Tranſlation <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> the Word. The Word in the

<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Words in the Greek ſignify, has look'd <hi>cloſe</hi> and <hi>dwelt</hi> upon it by ſerious <hi>Meditation,</hi> he being not a forgetful Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but a Doer of the <hi>Work,</hi> this Man ſhall be <hi>bleſſed</hi> in his doing, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.25.</p>
            <p>He therefore that deſires the Word ſhould encreaſe and multiply, muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive it in an honeſt and good Heart, but <hi>infix</hi> it there by ſerious <hi>Conſideration;</hi> and be not like thoſe compar'd to thorny Ground in the Parable, who, having heard the Word, go ſorth and think no more of it, but ſuffer the Cares and Pleaſures and Riches of the World to enter immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into their Minds and choak the Word, ſo that it becomes unfruitful: But by after-<hi>Meditation</hi> and <hi>Recollection</hi> of Thought make it ſink ſtill <hi>deeper</hi> into their Souls, and ſtrike a Root to the very <hi>Bottom</hi> of their Hearts.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:103289:19"/>
            <p>And indeed, without ſuch <hi>Conſideration,</hi> there can be very little Hope, if any, of its Fruitfulneſs. For, in all Learning, 'tis <hi>Meditation</hi> that gives a Root to what is read or heard, and fixes it deep in the Mind; 'tis that which makes it a Man's <hi>own,</hi> and ſerviceable to him upon occaſion; and <hi>without</hi> it, the moſt accurate Diſcourſe would tickle the Ear only, not inform the Underſtanding; and truly, the more <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,</hi> the leſs <hi>Beneficial,</hi> unleſs it be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and examined by a ſerious and near Inſpection.</p>
            <p>Thus, the Doctrin of Chriſtianity, tho the moſt excellent in it ſelf, as proceeding from the Divine <hi>Word,</hi> the Wiſdom of the Father, is ſeldom embrac'd as ſuch by Perſons of a trifling <hi>unthinking</hi> Spirit, but rather appears harſh and unreaſonable; or at beſt is but faintly approv'd of, and for a ſhort Continuance. For, the Beauties of Holineſs, like other chief Excellencies, are not to be clearly ſeen and <hi>fully</hi> diſcovered by a ſlight and curſory <hi>Glance,</hi> but by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and curious <hi>Search;</hi> like <hi>Gold,</hi> that is not to be found upon the <hi>Surface</hi> of the Earth, but lies further in, and is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up within her <hi>Bowels.</hi> Wherefore, as we tender our Perſeverance in the Faith and our eternal Salvation, we muſt not think our Task is over when we have <hi>heard</hi> the Word, but always ſet ſome time apart (and the ſooner the better) to meditate and lay it to <hi>Heart,</hi> and frequently <hi>revolve</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:103289:19"/>it in our Minds, conſider it in all its <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> and <hi>Tendencies,</hi> its Nature, and its happy and glorious Effects; and then we ſhall be intirely ſatisfyed that 'tis our moſt <hi>reaſonable</hi> Service, and above all things our Intereſt to practiſe its Divine Precepts, and that it flouriſh in our Souls, and bring forth Fruit in Abundance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This Seed ſo planted and fixed in this good Ground, muſt be likewiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently <hi>kept</hi> and <hi>preſerved</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>Sloth and Idle Careleſsneſs always have an ill Effect; and many hopeful beginnings are nipp'd and cruſh'd, and come to very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable concluſions, for want of that care and Induſtry, which was neceſſary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and further them to Perfection.</p>
            <p>But above all they are moſt Dangerous in Religion. For beſides that they <hi>Naturally</hi> tend to make Virtue weak and degenerate; they give a fair Occaſion to our <hi>great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> to aſſault us, (that infernal Bird of Prey, who is ready immediately to catch away the good Seed, if unregarded, and throw his wicked Suggeſtions into their Place) and who is glad to find us thus weak and unarm'd and careleſs of our Safety; and is too wiſe not to improve ſuch Opportunities to his beſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And what Hopes, but we ſhall be ſhamefully plundered of that Precious Seed which God has ſowed in our Hearts that it may ſpring up to <hi>Immortality,</hi> when we are thus careleſs and negligent, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103289:20"/>unable to make any great Reſiſtance!</p>
            <p>Therefore the Wiſe Man adviſes to keep the Heart with all <hi>Diligence;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 4.23.</note> and St.
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.5.</note> 
               <hi>Peter,</hi> to give all <hi>Diligence</hi> to add to our Faith Vertue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that <hi>ſo</hi> theſe good things may be in us and <hi>abound:</hi> And our Lord tells us,
<note place="margin">Mat. 13.25.</note> in the next Parable to this, that 'twas while Men <hi>ſlept</hi> that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my came and ſow'd Tares. Wherefore, <hi>awake</hi> to Righteouſneſs,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.34. 1 Pet. 3.8.</note> ſays St. <hi>Paul;</hi> be ſober, be <hi>vigilant,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Peter,</hi> for your Adverſary the Devil goeth about like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Let us therefore endeavour, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſes <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.2.</note> to <hi>keep</hi> that which is committed to our Truſt, and to walk <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly,</hi> not as <hi>Fools but as Wiſe; leſt as the Serpent beguiled</hi> Eve <hi>through his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, ſo our Minds ſhould be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Chriſt:</hi> We muſt be wiſe as Serpents as well as innocent as Doves; leſt, when the Word has begun to thrive and proſper in our Souls, it be at length rooted out by the Temptations of that old Serpent, and bring no Fruit to Perfection.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, we muſt expect the Encreaſe of this good Seed with <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance,</hi> and take care that the Fruits come to full Maturity.</p>
            <p>We muſt expect the Increaſe of this good Seed with <hi>Patience,</hi> becauſe all Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a thing of <hi>Time:</hi> Men can't ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at Perfection, even in <hi>Vice,</hi> in an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:103289:20"/>much leſs in <hi>Vertue.</hi> There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>intermedial</hi> Steps and Advances to it; and as when Seed is ſown there firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears but a tender <hi>Blade,</hi> which, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Time improves to a <hi>Stalk,</hi> which every day grows taller and ſtronger; and at length appears the <hi>Ear</hi> and the <hi>Grain</hi> in the Ear; and even after that compleat Formation of the Plant, there is yet ſome <hi>conſiderable</hi> Time before it comes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Ripeneſs;</hi> and all this while the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman waits with Patience till the Time comes of gathering the ripe Fruits of the Earth: So in Religion, there are <hi>gradual Advances</hi> to Perfection. The <hi>Beginnings</hi> of Religion, the firſt Sproutings of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Seed are and will be tender and unconfirm'd, but Time will ſtrengthen and improve them; every Day will make ſome Advance to Perfection, where there is an honeſt and good Heart, and Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity at the Bottom: But theſe Advances may be very leiſurely, and like the Growth of Plants, ſcarce diſcernable in their <hi>Progreſs,</hi> and yet at length the Word of God brings forth its genuine Fruits in great Abundance. And this, though perhaps ſlow pace in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, muſt be born with <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Hope; for in due Time,</hi> for all this, <hi>we ſhall reap if we faint not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this thoſe ſhould conſider who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be <hi>compleat</hi> Chriſtians in an <hi>inſtant,</hi> and are impatient of Delays, and diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by every Rub and Difficulty; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103289:21"/>their Practice can't keep pace with their too forward and paſſionate <hi>Wiſhes</hi> and <hi>Deſires,</hi> are apt to deſpair of ever coming to that <hi>Ripeneſs</hi> of Chriſtianity, which will fit them for their great Maſters Garner; and too often let ſlip what they have already attain'd, and give over in much Dejection after they have made a very hopeful Progreſs. But this is a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Artifice of the Devil, and ought, with the greateſt Care imaginable, to be provided againſt; and a Man's beſt Defence in this Caſe is <hi>Patience,</hi> or a calm and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd Expectation of Encreaſe and Bleſſing from God in his due Time, when we have done our own beſt Endeavour; <hi>a wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God's Leiſure,</hi> a confiding in his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs who only gives the Encreaſe. And (as St.
<note place="margin">Jam. 5.7.</note> 
               <hi>James</hi> expreſſes it) <hi>as the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman waiteth for the precious Fruit of the Earth, and hath long Patience for it, untill he receive the early and latter Rain;</hi> ſo ſhould we be alſo patient, and in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience poſſeſs our Souls and eſtabliſh our Hearts. For there is a <hi>latter</hi> Diſtillation of the Divine Grace as well as that which is <hi>early</hi> and at Firſt; and which, when God pleaſes to afford it, we ſhall then grow up to Perfection: And though ſometimes it may not be ſo plentifully ſhowr'd down as we could wiſh, yet will not be <hi>finally</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſufficient Degree, to ſuch as ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrace it and co-operate with it.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:103289:21"/>
            <p>And as our Lord expreſſes it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parable, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.26. (which, for its near Reſemblance to this and the next, I think it needleſs Particularly to diſcourſe of) <hi>The Kingdom of God,</hi> or of Grace, <hi>is as if a Man ſhould caſt Seed into the Ground, and ſhould ſleep and riſe, Night and Day, and the Seed ſhould ſpring up and grow he knoweth not how, from the Blade to the Ear, and to the full Corn in the Ear; and when the Fruit is ripe, he putteth in the Sickle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Harveſt is come.</hi> That is, tho' good Men's Progreſs in Religion often-times be not ſo quick and haſty as they may and wiſh; yet, though almoſt inſenſibly, it may daily grow and increaſe, and at laſt the perfect Fruits of Righteouſneſs be viſible in their Converſations.</p>
            <p>Therefore let not a ſlow Improvement diſcourage any Man that is ſincerely deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of making ſtill <hi>higher</hi> Advances, but let him hold faſt what he already hath, do his beſt Endeavour ſtill to grow in Grace and the Fruits of the Spirit, and then with Patience wait upon God for a more plentiful Increaſe.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, this Increaſe of the Word muſt be proportionable to the <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> of the Seed that is ſown, and to the <hi>Strength</hi> and Powers of the <hi>Soil</hi> in which it is ſown; that is, it muſt be according to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man's <hi>Ability,</hi> and the <hi>Opportunities</hi> he hath had of Improvement; in ſome <hi>Thirty,</hi> in ſome <hi>Sixty,</hi> and in ſome an <hi>Hundred-Fold.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:103289:22"/>
            <p>When a Husbandman ſowes his Seed, if he ſowes in great <hi>Plenty</hi> and upon <hi>good</hi> Ground, we know he expects to reap in a <hi>proportionable Abundance;</hi> and when he ſowes more <hi>ſparingly,</hi> and the Soil be not <hi>capable</hi> of ſo <hi>great</hi> an Increaſe, his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations are accordingly. And ſo it is in Religion; from ſuch as are of <hi>pregnant</hi> Parts and Abilities, able to entertain and conſider and make the beſt Uſe of the Word of God that is ſown in their Hearts, and likewiſe enjoy the great Bleſſing of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Inſtruction, and have the whole of Chriſtianity ſet before them in a true Light, all the Duties and Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it, ſo that there is all that can be done in order to an abundant Increaſe; from ſuch Men as theſe, God will expect <hi>much</hi> Fruit, even the Increaſe of <hi>an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred-Fold; they muſt abound</hi> in every good Word and Work; and the Word of God dwelling ſo <hi>richly</hi> in them, Line upon Line, Precept upon Precept, Treaſures of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction heap'd one upon another, a <hi>ſcanty</hi> penurious <hi>Increaſe</hi> will not be accepted, much leſs a total and intire <hi>Barrenneſs</hi> excus'd. For, ſo St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Heb. 6.7, 8. <hi>The Earth that drinketh in the Rain that cometh upon it, and bringeth forth Herbs meet for them by whom it is dreſſed, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Bleſſing from God; but that which bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Thorns and Briars, is rejected, and nigh unto Curſing, whoſe End is to be burn'd.</hi> And our Lord in very plain and expreſs
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103289:22"/>Terms ſays the ſame, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.48. <hi>Unto whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall much be required,</hi> and <hi>to whom Men have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted much, of him they will ask the more.</hi> But becauſe all Men are not of Abilities alike, nor have the ſame Opportunities of Inſtruction and Improvement; where there is any <hi>Defect</hi> either in the <hi>ſowing</hi> of the <hi>Seed,</hi> or in the <hi>Capacity</hi> of the <hi>Soil,</hi> God will proportionably abate in his Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Increaſe. But, though he will not expect the <hi>ſame Degree</hi> of Increaſe from every Man, yet he will expect <hi>ſome;</hi> if not an <hi>Hundred-Fold,</hi> yet <hi>Sixty;</hi> or if not <hi>Sixty,</hi> yet at leaſt <hi>Thirty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, if this be true, in what a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condition are Myriads of the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Word, who receive the Seed in great Plenty and Abundance, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble likewiſe to bring forth a conſiderable Increaſe; and yet are as unfruitful as if their Souls had lain always <hi>fallow,</hi> and were never cultivated and impregnated by the Means of Spiritual Inſtruction! Let ſuch be entreated by the Love of God and their own immortal Souls, to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, and ſhake off that ſtupid Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Inſenſibility that ſo fatally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets them, and bethink themſelves how ſad their Condition will be, when at the great Harveſt, the End of the World, when God will gather the ripe Fruits and diſpoſe them in his heavenly Garner; when at that great Day our Lord ſhall
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103289:23"/>expect Fruit from the Seed that he hath ſown upon their Hearts, and ſhall find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Briars and Thorns, Wickedneſs and Impurity: Let them bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what a ſad Condition they will be in, when their Unfruitfulneſs ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with everlaſting Burnings, and the Number and Sharpneſs of the Torments of Hell increas'd upon them, becauſe when they <hi>knew</hi> their Lord's Will, they did not prepare themſelves to do according to it.</p>
            <p>Let them conſider, that though God bears long with them, and frequently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunes them to a more ſerious Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon their Ways, that they would <hi>turn their Feet unto his Teſtimonies,</hi> and be no longer <hi>unprofitable Hearers, but Doers of his Word;</hi> yet it will not be <hi>always</hi> ſo, there will be an End of this Day of Grace and Forbearance, and how ſoon God alone can tell; and perhaps this Diſcourſe may be the laſt Invitation to a new Life, which ſome that hear it may ever have, or at leaſt, the laſt that ſhall be attended with that Divine <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can make it <hi>fruitful.</hi> Wherefore, <hi>now while it is call'd to day, harden not your Hearts, leſt God ſhould ſwear in his Wrath, that you ſhall never enter into his Reſt</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider what our Lord ſays upon this Account, in this of <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more Abundance; but whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken away even that which he
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103289:23"/>hath.</hi> The plain Meaning of which is this, He that hath made good Uſe of the Grace he hath already receiv'd, and the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions he hath already heard, ſhall receive abundantly more Grace, far greater Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and much larger and more frequent Showers of the divine Bleſſing than ever formerly he did: Chriſt will come in to him and ſup with him, and he with <hi>him,</hi> as 'tis expreſs'd, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. that is, will freely communicate to him of his divine Favours and Refreſhments, and there ſhall be mutual Feſtivity and Joy between them; his Saviour will take him into the neareſt Relation to himſelf; for he hath told us, that <hi>whoſoever ſhall do the Will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven, the ſame is his Brother, and Siſter and Mother;</hi> that is, as tenderly regarded by him as thoſe deareſt Relatives.</p>
            <p>And, how muſt that Soul thrive and flouriſh which is thus plentifully water'd with Showers above, and enrich'd with Streams iſſuing from the Fountain of Goodneſs! But on the contrary, How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable will be his Miſery that neglects and <hi>diſregards</hi> theſe Sermons of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and is not a Doer of the Word, but a careleſs Hearer only, deceiving, ſadly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his own Soul! From him ſhall be taken away even that which he hath; he ſhall be deprived of it to inrich his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious Brother and add to his Abundance. What Grace he had before ſhall be <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:103289:24"/>and he naked and defenſeleſs, left to the Fury of his Spiritual Enemies; the Dews of Heaven ſhall no longer drop up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>barren</hi> Soul, but parch'd and ſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it ſhall be reſerv'd to eternal Burnings. Conſider this, all ye that forget God, and are unfruitful under all his Care and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Nurture and Admonition; leſt at length he pluck you away and there be none to deliver you. And remember the Words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 29.1. <hi>He that being often reprov'd ſtill hardeneth his Neck, ſhall ſuddainly be deſtroyed, and that without Remedy.</hi>

            <p>And thus have I done with the firſt of our Saviours Parables, in which is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us a Bleſſing and a Curſe; a <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> if when the good Seed is ſown, and we have heard the Word, we receive it into honeſt and good Hearts, and according to our ſeveral Abilities bring forth Fruit to Perfection; that is, obey and Practiſe it with Conſtancy and Perſeverance: And a <hi>Curſe,</hi> if we remain ſtill barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful, not Doers of the Word but Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers only, deceiving our ſelves into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Perdition. It becomes us all therefore, to <hi>take heed how we hear;</hi> and not be like the <hi>High-way-ſide,</hi> ſuffering our Thoughts to wander from the Inſtructions we have heard, and leaving the good Seed unregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Mercy of the great Enemy of Souls; and expoſing our Minds as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Tract to vain and wicked Fancies
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103289:24"/>and Imaginations, and diabolical Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; nor like the <hi>ſtony</hi> Ground, impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable to any <hi>deep</hi> and laſting Impreſſions of the Word of Life; nor like that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with <hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>Briars</hi> and <hi>noxious Weeds,</hi> ſuch as are the <hi>Cares</hi> and <hi>deceitful Riches</hi> and Pleaſures of this Life, which will choak the Word and render it unfruitful: But, that we treaſure up this Divine Word in our Memories, ponder and conſider it, and ſet our Love and Affections upon it. So ſhall it grow and proſper and bring forth Fruit, in ſome Thirty, in ſome Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in ſome an Hundred-Fold; to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory of God, and the eternal Salvation of our immortal Souls. Which, God of his infinite Mercy grant for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his Sake.</p>

                  <bibl>

                  <p>Another Parable put Jeſus forth unto them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, The Kingdom of Heaven is likned unto a Man that ſowed good Seed in his Field:</p>
                  <p>But, while Men ſlept, his Enemy came and ſowed Tares among the Wheat, and went his way.</p>
                  <p>But when the Blade was ſprung up, and brought forth Fruit, then appeared the Tares alſo.</p>
                  <p>So the Servants of the Houſholder came and ſaid unto him, Sir, didſt not thou ſow good Seed in thy Field? From whence then hath it Tares?</p>
                  <p>He ſaid unto them, an Enemy hath done this. The Servants ſaid unto him, wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</p>
                  <p>But he ſaid nay; leſt while ye gather up the Tares, ye root up alſo the Wheat with them.</p>
                  <p>Let both grow together until the Harveſt; and in the time of Harveſt I will ſay to the Reapers, gather ye together firſt the Tares and bind them in Bundles to burn them: But gather the Wheat into my Barn.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Interpretation of this Parable is thus ſet down, Verſ. 37. of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>He that ſoweth the good Seed is the Son of Man, the Field is the World, the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103289:27"/>good Seeds are the Children of the Kingdom, but the Tares are the Children of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one; the Enemy that ſowed them is the Devil, the Harveſt is the End of the World, and the Reapers are the Angels. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Tares are gather'd and burnt in the Fire, ſo ſhall it be in the End of the World. The Son of Man ſhall ſend forth his Angels, and they ſhall gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and them that do Iniquity, and ſhall caſt them into a Furnace of Fire; there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth. Then ſhall the Righteous ſhine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Interpretation of this Parable, it appears, that the Deſign of it is to ſhew, for the Encouragement of the <hi>ſincerely</hi> good, and Terrour of the <hi>Hypocritical;</hi> that though there may be many <hi>wicked</hi> Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Chriſtianity, that are Chriſtians on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Out-ſide,</hi> and who in this World may be confuſedly intermix'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the good, and go <hi>undiſcover'd</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>unpuniſh'd</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> nay, <hi>thrive</hi> and <hi>proſper</hi> here more than the good, and to all outward Appearance, be the <hi>Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> of Heaven, whilſt the ſincerely good undergo many <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and appear to Men to be under God's <hi>Displeaſure:</hi> Yet, in the great Harveſt that ſhall be at the End of the World there ſhall be a Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made between the one and the other, the hypocritical ſhall be ſeparated from the ſincere, and the former conſign'd to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103289:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>ever laſting Burnings, and the latter receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Heavenly Regions, the Place prepared for them from the Beginning of the World.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Deſign</hi> of the Parable. We ſhall now briefly conſider how <hi>aptly</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive it is of this Senſe, and then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe upon the ſeveral Parts of it.</p>
            <p>The planting of the Goſpel in the World in order to the converting Men to Chriſtianity, is compared to the <hi>ſowing of Seed,</hi> becauſe (as was ſaid upon the former Parable) the Goſpel, like <hi>Seed,</hi> is that <hi>Principle</hi> of a future great <hi>Increaſe</hi> of Piety and Holineſs in this World, and of Glory and Happineſs in the next: 'Tis that, which, if ſincerely embrac'd, and its Growth and Progreſs not hindred, will ſpring up to <hi>Glory, Honour and Immortality:</hi> And 'tis ſaid to be like Seed <hi>ſown</hi> or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Furrows, and then left to its own <hi>ſeminal Powers</hi> and the favourable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of <hi>Heaven;</hi> becauſe the Goſpel, being <hi>actually planted</hi> in the World, is, as to <hi>particular</hi> Perſons, left to make its Way by its own <hi>Power and Efficacy,</hi> the <hi>Excellency</hi> of its <hi>Precepts,</hi> and its <hi>tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Rewards and Puniſhments;</hi> together with the conſtant Dews of the <hi>Divine Grace</hi> that attend it; without any more <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> Means, unleſs upon ſome <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Occaſion,</hi> to make it take Root and fructify. 'Tis <hi>generally</hi> propos'd to <hi>all,</hi> in its whole <hi>Latitude;</hi> which is the <hi>ſowing</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:103289:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>of it, and then Men are left to their own free Choice, whether they will <hi>embrace</hi> it with its <hi>Promiſes,</hi> or turn their <hi>Backs</hi> upon it and run the Hazard of its <hi>Threats,</hi> without any <hi>irreſiſtible Force</hi> to the one or the other; only the <hi>ſmall ſtill Voice</hi> of God's Spirit in Men's Hearts, and <hi>Grace</hi> deſcending like the <hi>gentle Dew,</hi> to ſoften and incline them to <hi>cheriſh</hi> this good Seed, which is the leaving the Goſpel to its <hi>own ſeminal Powers,</hi> with only the benign Waterings of the Divine Grace and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Lord</hi> is call'd the <hi>Sower</hi> of the good Seed, becauſe he is the <hi>Author</hi> and firſt Teacher of this holy Religion; and its Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity to the great Purpoſes to which it is deſign'd, depends upon the Merit of his bitter Death and Paſſion, and the <hi>invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating</hi> Vertue of his <hi>precious Blood.</hi> For, 'twas upon his ſatisfying the Divine Juſtice by his <hi>Death,</hi> that he receiv'd Authority to mark out to us <hi>this</hi> Way to Life and Reconciliation, as the only Principle and Seed of Immortality.</p>
            <p>The <hi>World</hi> is call'd the Field where this Seed is ſown, becauſe this bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is <hi>catholick</hi> and <hi>univerſal,</hi> not confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any <hi>particular Place</hi> or <hi>People</hi> as the Jewiſh Religion was, but <hi>whoſoever,</hi> of what <hi>Nation</hi> or <hi>People</hi> ſoever, ſhall <hi>believe</hi> in Jeſus, and <hi>repent,</hi> ſhall be ſaved. And agreeably in another Parable (which, for its great Analogy to this, I ſhall not particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103289:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>diſcourſe of) the Goſpel, or Kingdom of Chriſt is repreſented by a Net caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Sea;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 13.47.</note> not any particular <hi>Lake</hi> or <hi>River:</hi> And <hi>this</hi> World is ſtiled the Field, becauſe <hi>this</hi> is the only Place of receiving this Seed and bringing forth the genuine and expected Fruits of it; and he that ſhall refuſe to receive this divine Seed <hi>now</hi> while he continues <hi>here,</hi> or not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to grow and increaſe and bring forth <hi>Fruit;</hi> ſhall never have the like Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity <hi>again,</hi> but ſuffer for ever the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment threatned to <hi>obſtinate Infidelity,</hi> or <hi>barren Unfruitfulneſs. This</hi> World is the only <hi>Field, this Life</hi> the only <hi>Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,</hi> and at the End of it comes that one great <hi>Harveſt,</hi> which ſhall conſign Men to an <hi>eternal</hi> Condition, either happy or miſerable, according to their Barrenneſs or Fruitfulneſs, during this Time, and in this Place of Growth and Increaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Children of the Kingdom,</hi> or thoſe that are <hi>ſincere</hi> Chriſtians, intirely devoted to the Service of their great Maſter, and have receiv'd the good Seed of the Goſpel into <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>good Hearts,</hi> as 'tis expreſs'd in the preceeding Parable: Theſe are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves likewiſe compared to <hi>good Seed,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have a <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Piety, the <hi>Power</hi> as well as the <hi>Form</hi> and Appearance of Godlineſs, and bring forth the genuine Fruits of their holy Religion. That di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Seed that was ſown in their Hearts, has produced, not only the <hi>Blade</hi> in the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103289:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Ear,</hi> but the <hi>full Grain</hi> in the Ear; the ſame Kind of Seed that was <hi>ſown,</hi> appears in their Lives and Converſations; the Seed of the <hi>Spirit</hi> brings forth the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the Seed of <hi>Holineſs</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces <hi>real</hi> and ſubſtantial <hi>Holineſs;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is called <hi>good Seed,</hi> as 'tis the firſt <hi>Principle</hi> of Holineſs; and truly <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men</hi> are likewiſe call'd <hi>good Seed,</hi> as the genuine <hi>Product</hi> and <hi>Increaſe</hi> of that firſt Principle. The <hi>Goſpel</hi> is the good Seed <hi>ſown,</hi> and the ſincerely <hi>religious</hi> are the good Seed as <hi>ſpringing</hi> from it and being <hi>produc'd</hi> by it.</p>
            <p>The Children of the wicked one, or the <hi>hypocritical</hi> Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, are compared to <hi>Tares</hi> or <hi>Gockle,</hi> becauſe they have only a Shew and <hi>Appearance</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as Tares and Cockle have of Corn; but like them, no <hi>Subſtance</hi> of good Corn, none of the <hi>real Excellencies</hi> of Religion, nothing but <hi>hurtful</hi> and <hi>vicious</hi> Qualities as Tares are ſaid to have; hurtful to <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> in the final Conſequence, as bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to ſo miſerable an End; and hurtful to <hi>others</hi> by their ill Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Converſe, as Tares to Wheat; and likewiſe injurious to the <hi>holy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> they profeſs, as reflecting Diſhonour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it by their ſcandalous Converſation. Upon all Accounts 'tis <hi>infoelix Lolium,</hi> as the Poet calls it; <hi>unhappy</hi> Tares they are, that bring <hi>Diſhonour</hi> upon <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> upon <hi>themſelves</hi> and <hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:103289:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The <hi>Devil</hi> is very fitly ſtiled the <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> that <hi>ſows</hi> theſe Tares, becauſe he is the buſy Prompter to Vice and Hypocriſy, and the great Encourager of it, by his ſly and wheedling Inſinuations and wicked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections: He is that great Enemy of God and all things heavenly and good, and whoſe conſtant Endeavour it is to oppoſe and weaken the Kingdom of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and upon the Ruins of it to eſtabliſh his infernal Dominion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>End of the World</hi> is compared to the <hi>Harveſt,</hi> becauſe then is the Time of Gods gathering all Men from off the Face of the Earth, and diſpoſing them according to their Deſervings, into a new State of endleſs Happineſs or Miſery; as <hi>good Corn</hi> at Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, is taken from off the Ground, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed-away, and laid up in Repoſitories of Safety; but the Tares and other noxious Weeds ſever'd from the reſt, and bound up in Bundles to be burnt. And the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> are ſaid to be the <hi>Reapers</hi> at this great Harveſt; becauſe 'tis by their Miniſtry that God will execute his moſt equal Sentence, whether of Abſolution or Condemnation; the <hi>Righteous</hi> ſhall by them be caught up into the Clouds to meet their Lord in the Air, and like good Corn, be laid up, and that for ever, in God's heavenly Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>for they ſhall ever be with the Lord;</hi> And the wicked and <hi>hypocritical</hi> ſhall by them be ſeparated from the good, and like vile Tares, be thrown into a <hi>Furnace of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103289:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>Fire unquenchable.</hi> And thus much in ſhort for the Aptneſs of this Parable to expreſs the Senſe that our Lord conceal'd under it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to conſider its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts: And it will inform us of ſix things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it will inform us of the <hi>State</hi> of the Chriſtian Church in <hi>this</hi> World; that there will be both good and bad under the general Name of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (as Tares and Wheat together, go under the Name of one Field of Corn) and that the Two firſt Planters of this Good and Evil reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, are <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there will be both good and bad in this World under the general Name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> will be no wonder to any Man that conſiders how many there are that are Chriſtians by <hi>Cuſtom</hi> and <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> only, becauſe their Fathers were ſo before 'em, and in their tender Years pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd their Reception into that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but, ſeldom look any further into the <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Inducements</hi> to ſuch Belief, and trouble themſelves but very little to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd</hi> in, much leſs to <hi>practiſe</hi> the Duties that are bound upon them by that holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: And for the ſame Reaſon would have been Mahometans or Jews had their Parents been ſo, and educated them in that Way, and therefore are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> by <hi>Chance,</hi> not <hi>Choice.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:103289:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>And this, thoſe would do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider who ſpend the whole Six Days of the Week in drudging for the World from Morning until Night; and then, like tir'd Beaſts, when they have fill'd their Bellies, without any further Thoughts, lay them down to reſt; and when the Lord's Day comes (which is deſign'd for the Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Improvement of their Souls in Piety and Goodneſs, and their <hi>Inſtruction</hi> in the Religion they profeſs to be of) make little better Uſe of it than their Horſes do in the Stable, reſt from bodily Labour, and ſaunter and prate and drink away the Day; but ſeldom come at the Places of divine Worſhip and Inſtruction; and if <hi>they do,</hi> are as little the better for it as if they were abſent. Let ſuch conſider, before it be too late, whether <hi>this Sort</hi> of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity will bring 'em to Heaven or no? Whether their being <hi>baptized</hi> in their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy</hi> will ſave 'em without any <hi>more to do?</hi> Whether their telling our Lord at the Day of Judgment, that they happen'd to be born in a Country where his holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was profeſs'd, and of ſuch as call'd themſelves Chriſtians, and were by them preſented to a Miniſter of Chriſt who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd them into the Pale of the Catholick Church, and that they continued to call themſelves Chriſtians all their Lives, and now and then came to Church as other Chriſtians did: Let them conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at that great Day ſuch an empty Plea

            <p>Further, 'tis no ſtrange thing to find <hi>ill</hi> Men amongſt a Society of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Men</hi> are <hi>free Agents;</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> does not <hi>force,</hi> but only by proper Methods <hi>incline</hi> and <hi>perſwade:</hi> And thoſe, who in their <hi>Infancy</hi> were devoted to the Service of God, and educated in his Diſcipline in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103289:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>their <hi>tender</hi> Years, may yet, through the Predominancy of their <hi>Luſts</hi> and <hi>vile Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> and the <hi>Temptations</hi> of the <hi>wicked</hi> one, together with their own careleſs <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency,</hi> be, when grown up, inclined to live at quite another Rate than Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity allows: And though, for Faſhion's ſake, they may retain the <hi>Name</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, yet chooſe to be <hi>indeed</hi> the Servants of their own <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and of the <hi>Prince of Darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, 'tis very unreaſonable for the Enemies of Religion to conclude as they do, that becauſe many that <hi>profeſs</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, live in direct <hi>Contradiction</hi> to it; therefore the whole is a <hi>Cheat:</hi> Becauſe, did they believe what that Religion teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to be true; they would not dare to live in ſuch continual <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>Indeed, this ſhould make all Chriſtians very careful and circumſpect in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, leſt they bring ſo great a Scandal as this upon their holy Religion (remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring our Lord's Words, <hi>Woe be to him, by whom the Offence or Scandal cometh:)</hi> But it will not at all follow, that becauſe ſome of a Profeſſion live contrary to its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Doctrin, that therefore the whole is a <hi>Forgery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, <hi>believing</hi> and <hi>doing</hi> are Two very <hi>different</hi> things; and a Man may <hi>habitual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> aſſent to the Truth of a thing, and yet not <hi>actually attend</hi> to it: As a Man may be very well aſſured that there is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103289:32"/>
               <hi>Pit</hi> in his Way, and yet be ſo tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up with minding other things, as not to <hi>attend</hi> to the Danger, and heedleſsly <hi>fall into it.</hi> And ſo a Man may <hi>habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> believe that there is a Pit of Bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Deſtruction, which will at length ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up the incorrigibly wicked; and yet, be ſo deeply engag'd in the Pleaſures and Follies of the World, as not to <hi>attend</hi> to it till 'tis too late.</p>
            <p>But, ſuppoſe <hi>ſome</hi> that <hi>call</hi> themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> do <hi>not at all believe</hi> any thing of the Chriſtian Religion; there are innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable more that <hi>do</hi> believe and live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; and the Harmony of their Belief and Practice, methinks ſhould be a better Argument in the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity and Debauchery of a few <hi>titular</hi> Chriſtians ſhould be in the <hi>Negative.</hi> And though to a Man that ſtiles himſelf a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> and yet believes not a Word of the Matter, to <hi>him</hi> the Whole of Religion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> is as nothing, yet certainly it cannot be from thence concluded, that therefore 'tis <hi>really</hi> and indeed a <hi>Fiction.</hi> For, that may be aſſuredly <hi>true,</hi> and that to their <hi>Coſt,</hi> which ſome Men <hi>don't care</hi> to <hi>believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee 'tis no ſtrange thing that there ſhould be both good and bad that go under the general Name of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in <hi>this</hi> World; and that though ſome are much ſcandaliz'd at it, and raiſe an Objection from it againſt the Truth of the Religion, yet there is no Reaſon ſo to do; for, 'tis not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103289:32"/>the <hi>Name</hi> that makes a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is a Chriſtian <hi>indeed,</hi> that to a <hi>right Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> adjoins <hi>good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Planters</hi> of the good Seed or the Tares, the bad or good Profeſſors of Chriſtianity reſpectively, are <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Devil. Chriſt,</hi> by teaching a holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to the World, ſuch as ſhall conduct Men to Glory and Immortality, and by the good Motions and Inſpirations of his holy Spirit, inclining 'em to imbrace it, does endeavour to make all Men <hi>happy,</hi> to deliver 'em from the Miſeries of <hi>this</hi> World, (for if <hi>Sin</hi> were weeded out of it, there would be no <hi>Miſery</hi> in it) and to prepare 'em for the eternal and ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Felicities of the Kingdom of Glory; in which, after a perſevering Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs here, they ſhall be actually inſtated. The Devil, on the contrary, that great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy both to God and Man, makes it <hi>his</hi> great Endeavour, by all Sorts of Wiles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd Stratagems, to <hi>obliterate</hi> the divine Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of this holy Religion upon Mens Souls, to divert 'em from <hi>attending</hi> to its great Beauty and Excellency, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Duration of its Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments; to perſwade 'em that <hi>here</hi> lies the only Scene of Happineſs, and that a <hi>future</hi> Felicity or Miſery is only fit to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe and frighten Children withall; that the Deſires of the Body are given us that we might gratify them to the <hi>full,</hi> and that to <hi>deny</hi> and <hi>mortify our ſelves,</hi> is the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103289:33"/>moſt unnatural Cruelty in the World; that we muſt make our ſelves happy, while we have <hi>Opportunity,</hi> and not truſt too much to uncertain Reverſions: And, when he can't <hi>wholly blot out</hi> the Belief of another World, then he endeavours to <hi>corrupt</hi> it, by perſwading us that a very little Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will ſerve turn, ſeeing we have to do with ſo <hi>merciful</hi> a God.</p>
            <p>And, if by theſe Means or the like, of which he has great Variety, he can incline Men, if not intirely to <hi>apoſtatize</hi> from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, yet, like <hi>Tares,</hi> to reſt ſatisfyed with the Name and <hi>Appearance</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and live at looſe and random, and follow the Stream of their own Paſſions and Deſires, and his ſly Inſinuations and tempting Deluſions; then he has his End, and will at length cheat 'em of the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that Chriſt deſign'd 'em, and decoy 'em into his own Poſſeſſion, and ſo bring them to the Portion of Tares and noxious Weeds, that <hi>Furnace of Fire prepar'd for himſelf and his Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, as we tender our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Welfare, we muſt be very watchful and obſervant, that we may diſcover the ſly Inſinuations of this our great Enemy. Whatever would diſparage Religion, or leſſen the Obligation to a good Life, comes certainly from that infernal Tempter. The Temptations to an exceſſive Gratification of our bodily Appetites, aſſuredly come from <hi>him;</hi> the <hi>Opportunities</hi> of <hi>Vice</hi> are
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103289:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>of his diſpoſing, and 'tis he that ingages us in ſo great a Love and earneſt Perſuit of the <hi>World.</hi> And therefore every thing of this Nature muſt be rejected with the greateſt Abomination, as the Endeavours of our great Enemy, to deprive us of our Happineſs, and involve us in his own Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</p>
            <p>And, on the contrary, thoſe bleſſed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that we all of us often feel to a more pious and holy Converſation, muſt be thankfully embrac'd, and chearfully fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, as the Directions and Excitations of our dear Saviour, to what is conducive to our eternal Happineſs. They are thoſe heavenly Dews which will refreſh our Souls, and improve their Growth and Increaſe in Holineſs; and if ſincerely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operated with, will at length bring the Fruits of our holy Religion to Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the firſt thing this Parable informs us of, namely, That the State of the Goſpel in <hi>this</hi> World is ſuch, that there will be both bad and good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the general Name of Chriſtians (as good Corn and Weeds together go under the Name of one Field of Corn) and that the firſt Planters of this Good and Evil reſpectively, are Chriſt and the Devil; together with the Improvement of each Conſideration to the Intereſt of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:103289:34"/>
            <p>But, before I quite leave this Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I ſhall, from what has been ſaid of the promiſcuous Mixture of bad and good Men in the Chriſtian Church, and God's ſuffering it to be ſo without any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Diſcrimination; From this I ſhall obſerve how unreaſonable 'tis for ſome to object, as too many do, againſt the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord's Supper in our Church, becauſe, as they ſay, we admit any that will come, even thoſe that have been ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Livers, and by that Means the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity is prophan'd and made leſs bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to the <hi>good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, <hi>ſuppoſing,</hi> though not <hi>granting</hi> that we admit any that will come, though Men of ill Lives, (I ſay, not <hi>granting</hi> this, for the thing is evidently falſe, as appears from the <hi>Exhortations</hi> to the Communicants before, and at the Solemnity, and from the <hi>Rubric</hi> of that Office: And from the 26, 27, and 28th <hi>Cannons</hi> of our Church, in which Miniſters are expreſly forbidden to admit <hi>notorious Offenders, Schiſmaticks</hi> and <hi>Strangers</hi> to the Communion.) But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this, which is ſo evidently <hi>falſe</hi> as to the <hi>Church,</hi> to be <hi>true</hi> as to ſome <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Miniſters;</hi> why muſt communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſuch Miniſters, and, as we think, in ſuch prophane Company, be unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly abſtain'd from, and the Miniſters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd againſt with ſo much Bitterneſs? At this rate they may as well deſert the Communion of the <hi>whole</hi> Church of Chriſt,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103289:34"/>and refuſe to join in <hi>any</hi> part of divine Worſhip; for no Doubt but ill Men are intermxi'd in <hi>all,</hi> though they may not be <hi>diſcover'd;</hi> and if their Company will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallow and make ineffecutal <hi>one</hi> Duty of Chriſtianity, I can't ſee why it ſhould not do the like to all the reſt. And, if a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration were admitted upon ſuch Accounts as as theſe, there would be no ſuch thing as an <hi>external Communion of Saints,</hi> becauſe, ſuch is the State of the Goſpel in this World, that the bad will be intermix'd with the Good, as Tares are in a Field of Wheat.</p>
            <p>And as to the Practice of particular Miniſters, I charitably hope none do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of <hi>notorious</hi> Offenders to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, without receiving ſatisfactory Marks of their <hi>Repentance,</hi> or at leaſt by previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diſcourſe or writing: When they know of their Intention to communicate, let 'em know the great Danger of receiving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, and urge them to an immediate ſincere Repentance, or elſe forbid 'em at their Peril to approach the holy Table. And if after all this they will come, we are to ſuppoſe in Charity, that they have <hi>repented,</hi> except we are ſure to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>And, if a Miniſter ſees one at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whoſe Life has, in many Inſtances, to his Knowledg, been very faulty, unleſs the Crimes have been very <hi>great</hi> and very <hi>noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;</hi> to reject ſuch an one, I think, (with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103289:35"/>Submiſſion) would be arrogant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, and might exaſperate the Man to ſo high a Degree, as to make him throw off <hi>all</hi> Regard to Religion for the future; and in ſuch a Caſe the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appointed to be read at the Time of celebrating thoſe Holy Myſteries, ſhould, one would think, be Warning ſufficient for ſuch an one, if <hi>unrepentant,</hi> to <hi>withdraw;</hi> and if he <hi>ſtays,</hi> Charity would incline one to believe that he was <hi>penitent.</hi> And, if a Perſon kneeling by, who, perhaps knows much more of the Man's Courſe of Life than the Miniſter, ſhall be offended at his communicating one that receives ſo <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,</hi> and ſpeak hard things of him, and abſtain from that bleſſed Ordinance upon this Account for the future, as prophan'd by ſuch mix'd Company at it; this is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unreaſonable, uncharitable and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. 'Tis <hi>unreaſonable</hi> with Relation to their hard Thoughts and Cenſures of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, becauſe <hi>Charity</hi> obliges <hi>him</hi> to think <hi>well</hi> of ſuch as preſent themſelves at the <hi>holy Table,</hi> unleſs there be great and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable <hi>Evidence</hi> of their <hi>obſtinate</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd</hi> Wickedneſs; and in ſuch a Caſe I dare ſay no pious Miniſter would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute thoſe holy Symbols to ſuch Swine: And, where there is not ſuch Evidence, Miniſters can ſearch Mens <hi>Hearts</hi> no more than other Men, and therefore muſt hope the <hi>beſt,</hi> and judge according to the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Appearance;</hi> and ſhould they commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103289:35"/>ſome that receive <hi>unworthily,</hi> by this Means (as 'tis to be fear'd they too often do) why ſhould they be blam'd for that which 'tis impoſſible for 'em to help; and <hi>aſpers'd,</hi> and all further Communion with them deſerted, for ſuffering that <hi>ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> which <hi>God,</hi> though the <hi>Searcher of all Hearts,</hi> permits in his Church without any open Diſcrimination; namely, the bad to join in all holy Offices with the good? And this Practice is as <hi>uncharitable</hi> as 'tis unreaſonable, becauſe 'tis judging and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning thoſe as Reprobates obſtinate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repenting Sinners, whoſe <hi>Hearts</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee; and who, though formerly egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly wicked, yet now, through the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Efficacy of God's converting Grace, may, for ought we know, to the contrary, be better than our ſelves. And, 'tis an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> Practice too, becauſe 'tis the depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our ſelves of the <hi>Comforts</hi> that attend the Reception of that holy Sacrament, and thoſe of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> and <hi>brotherly Love,</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon a <hi>groundleſs Nicety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us all rather learn not to judge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before the Time, but leave every Man to ſtand or fall by the unerring Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our great Maſter at the laſt Day; leſt by judging others we condemn our ſelves who do the ſame things, and it may be worſe. And, inſtead of abſtaining from the Sacrament, becauſe ſome come and are admitted to it, whom we think, and it may be not without Reaſon, are not
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103289:36"/>ſo well prepar'd as they ſhould be; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make our <hi>ſelves</hi> ſtill more and more fit for ſo holy an Ordinance by a day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Amendment of Life; and then <hi>our Fleece,</hi> like that of <hi>Gideon,</hi> ſhall be <hi>moiſtned,</hi> tho' <hi>other</hi> Men's be <hi>dry.</hi> The Apoſtles were never the <hi>leſs</hi> dear to our Saviour for <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> his being amongſt 'em, but the <hi>more</hi> ſo rather; and though, through the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs that was in his Heart, Satan enter'd into him after he had receiv'd the Sop our Lord gave him at the Celebration of the Paſſover, and in all Probability did partake of what he conſecrated in Memory of his ſucceeding Death and Sufferings; yet the reſt receiv'd miraculous Aſſiſtances of the holy Ghoſt, and were faithful to the Death, and for certain have receiv'd the Crown of Life. And I hope this will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisſy for the future, ſuch as upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count have abſtain'd from the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and cenſur'd the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of our Church, and (though without all Reaſon) our <hi>Church it ſelf:</hi> And as what has been ſaid upon this Matter, has been no <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent</hi> Digreſſion, ſo I hope it may be a <hi>beneficial</hi> one.</p>
            <p>Let us now proceed to the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing this Parable informs us of, namely, The <hi>Time when</hi> God's and our great Enemy the Devil ſowes his Tares among the Wheat, and that is while Men <hi>ſleep.</hi> For ſo the Parable, <hi>while Men ſlept the Enemy came and ſow'd Tares among the Wheat and went
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103289:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>his Way. Then</hi> is the Time of his injecting his wicked Inſinuations into Men's Hearts, whereby to make 'em become like <hi>empty Tares,</hi> Chriſtians in Name and <hi>Appearance</hi> only, but devoid of the <hi>ſubſtantial Graces</hi> and Vertues of that holy Profeſſion,</p>
            <p>By Men's <hi>ſleeping</hi> is here meant a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Inadvertency</hi> and Neglect of the things of <hi>Religion;</hi> a ſtupid Security in a <hi>thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> Way of Life. And this is a Metaphor which the ſacred Writers have often made uſe of to this Purpoſe; and 'tis ſo expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of what they would repreſent by it, that 'twill be worth our while briefly to conſider, wherein the Likeneſs of ſuch thoughtleſs Inadvertency in religious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>ſleep,</hi> does conſiſt.</p>
            <p>It is like it, in the firſt Place in its <hi>Cauſe:</hi> For, as Toil and <hi>Labour</hi> and any thing that brings <hi>Wearineſs</hi> and conſumes the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, diſpoſes the <hi>Body</hi> to <hi>Sleep,</hi> and makes it deſire Reſt and Eaſe that it may have a <hi>Recruit;</hi> ſo this <hi>moral</hi> Drowſineſs or Hebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the <hi>Soul,</hi> generally begins to creep upon Men, when they find <hi>difficulty</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; a little ſtriving ſoon puts 'em out of Heart, their Hands fall, their Knees grow feeble, their Soul <hi>faints</hi> within 'em, all Hope of Victory is then laid aſide, and they ſit them down as Men quite ſpent, and <hi>then</hi> ſteals that <hi>deep Sleep</hi> upon them which too often ends in <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we often ſee Men ſet very brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Practice of Religion at <hi>Firſt,</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:103289:37"/>and ſeem wondrouſly pleas'd with their new Choice, and admire at their Stupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that they did not <hi>ſooner</hi> diſcover the tranſcendent Beauties of Holineſs, and are reſolv'd to <hi>redeem</hi> their miſ-ſpent Time, and talk of nothing but Raptures, and of reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great <hi>Hights</hi> and <hi>Eminencies</hi> of Piety; when all on the ſuddain they are at a <hi>Stand,</hi> there's a <hi>Lyon</hi> in the Way, a <hi>right Hand</hi> muſt be <hi>cut off,</hi> or a right <hi>Eye</hi> put out, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſome <hi>Favourite</hi> Vice muſt be caſhier'd if they move any <hi>further,</hi> and that's a <hi>hard</hi> Saying, and the Men begin to <hi>cool,</hi> a <hi>Stifneſs</hi> ſeizes their over-heated Limbs, and a ſenſeleſs Torpor invades every Part of 'em;
<note place="margin">Mark 10.21.</note> and like the young Man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, whom our Lord began to love for his diſcreet Anſwers and towardly Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, when they muſt part with their <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> to the <hi>Poor,</hi> and <hi>deny</hi> themſelves, their corrupt Deſires and Inclinations, and take up their <hi>Croſs</hi> and follow their Saviour: Then they become <hi>ſad,</hi> and with Grief and <hi>Diſſatisfaction leave</hi> him, and fold their Hands, and return again to their <hi>Dream of Vanity.</hi> Juſt like thoſe in the former Parable, compar'd to <hi>ſtony Ground,</hi> who receiv'd the Word at firſt with <hi>Joy,</hi> but having not ſufficient Deepneſs of Earth, <hi>i.e.</hi> for want of through Conſideration, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the <hi>ſmooth</hi> Side of Religion only, endure but for a <hi>while,</hi> and in Time of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Difficulty, fall away, and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Piety becomes dry and wither'd. Or
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103289:37"/>like thoſe mention'd in another Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.28. (which was ſpoken upon this very Account, and which, for its great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity with this Part of the Parable we are now upon, I ſhall not particularly diſcourſe of) who <hi>begin to build, and ſit not down firſt and count the Coſt whether they be able to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi> and ſo proceeding no further than <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> become the Scorn of all Men. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, as a State of careleſs Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency to the things of Religion, is like <hi>Sleep</hi> in its <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Beginning;</hi> ſo likewiſe is it, in its Progreſs and Effects. For, like <hi>Sleep,</hi> it <hi>locks</hi> up all the Powers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul, and <hi>ſuſpends</hi> their <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> it <hi>dulls</hi> its <hi>Apprehenſion,</hi> and makes it take Evil for Good, and Good for Evil; it <hi>vitiates</hi> its <hi>Reaſoning,</hi> and makes it draw falſe and fantaſtick Conſequences and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions; and therefore <hi>corrupts</hi> its <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> and makes its <hi>Choices</hi> ſtrangely <hi>fooliſh</hi> and <hi>ridiculous,</hi> ſuch as preferring <hi>Earth</hi> before <hi>Heaven,</hi> a <hi>little Eaſe</hi> and <hi>imperfect Pleaſure</hi> here, before <hi>Rivers</hi> of <hi>ineffable Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> that are at <hi>God's right Hand for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more;</hi> and the like. The <hi>lower</hi> Life is in this Caſe <hi>predomimant,</hi> and wild <hi>Dreams</hi> and incoherent Fancies, make up ſuch Men's Divinity, and their Rule of Life and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. In ſhort, the Life of ſuch Men is but a <hi>Dream;</hi> their <hi>Notions,</hi> like thoſe of Men in a Slumber, dark, hovering and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; their <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> about <hi>religious</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, broken, disjointed unconcluding, full
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103289:38"/>of Fallacies and dangerous Sophiſtry, to cheat themſelves of all <hi>Expectation</hi> here and <hi>Enjoyment</hi> hereafter of what is their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, nay, their <hi>only Happineſs.</hi> Their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are like thoſe done in a <hi>Dream</hi> too, extravagant, brutiſh, and unaccountable; ſtartled at <hi>Chimaera's</hi> and the <hi>Shadows</hi> of Danger, and <hi>inſenſible</hi> of the Approaches of <hi>real</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Miſery, though juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to overtake them; <hi>fond</hi> of a Bundle of <hi>Feathers,</hi> in <hi>love</hi> with an <hi>aery Nothing,</hi> whilſt their <hi>true</hi> Intereſt is not in all their Thoughts. And, to <hi>compleat</hi> the Parallel, they are as deaf to all <hi>Reproofs</hi> as Men aſleep; as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle affected with good Inſtruction and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and ſo bewitch'd with the Fanci'd <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> of their Slumber, that they are as <hi>loath</hi> to be <hi>awaken'd:</hi> And when by <hi>rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> Applications they <hi>are,</hi> like Men that have taken too large a Doſe of Opium, they are preſently o'ercome with Heavineſs, and ſhut their Eyes againſt all Conviction and fall aſleep again. And the final Event is this; that as <hi>natural</hi> Drowſineſs cloaths a Man with <hi>Raggs,</hi> ſo the <hi>moral</hi> will cloath him with <hi>Shame and utter Confuſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, from this ſhort Parallel which I have drawn between the Sleep of the Soul and the Body; as we may ſee the Fitneſs of the Expreſſion in the Parable, ſo we may learn what Guard to keep up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelves to prevent our infernal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ſowing his <hi>Tares,</hi> or making <hi>us</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as ſuch, by his wicked Inſinuations
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103289:38"/>and Suggeſtions. 'Tis while Men thus <hi>ſleep,</hi> are thus thoughtleſs and inadvertent to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and taken up with the Gaieties and Pleaſures of this World, which, like plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Dreams, entertain the <hi>Fancy</hi> and <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination</hi> with much Delight, but ſoon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and become utterly unprofitable; <hi>then</hi> it is that this ſubtle Enemy makes uſe of his Opportunity, and unobſerv'd, <hi>ſteals</hi> in his wicked Injections, which divert the Soul ſtill <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more</hi> from attending to her main Intereſt, and promote this ſpiritual Slumber ſo long, 'till too often it becomes chronical and habitual, and an utter Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion of all religious Obligations, an incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Numneſs and Stupidity of Soul, God knows, too often follows; and Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like <hi>Tares,</hi> empty of all ſubſtantial Goodneſs, and at beſt but Chriſtians in Name and Shew, and fit for nothing, but when God ſhall ſee fit, to be gathered up from among the Wheat and burnt.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it highly concerns all thoſe that hope to be <hi>ſav'd, not to ſleep as do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but to watch and be ſober; to awake to Righteouſneſs, and walk circumſpectly, not as Fools</hi> diverted by every Feather and gay Appearance, but, as Men that are wiſe to Salvation, always in a Poſture of Watchfulneſs and Defence. Fixing our Attention upon our Duty and the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Reward of it, and often reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that intolerable Miſery, which will certainly be the Conſequence of ſuch
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103289:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>fatal Slumberings, and ſtill preſſing <hi>on</hi> with greater Courage as the Difficulties of Religion increaſe upon us; and daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring ſtill more and more to ſhake off dead Stupidity to Religion which ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily beſets us, and to rouze up the Faculties and employ 'em upon thoſe nobleſt of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, patiently receiving Inſtruction and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; rejecting every Notion and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that would deſtroy the Neceſſity of a good Life, and ſtudiouſly avoiding <hi>Idleneſs</hi> and <hi>Sloth;</hi> and, according to our Lord's moſt excellent Advice, adding <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi> that <hi>we enter not into Temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Courſe if we take, we ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat this generally prevailing Stratagem of the ſubtle Tempter; and being always in a Readineſs to reſiſt him, make him fly from us with Shame and Diſappointment. And our Souls will then grow more and more <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> in Piety, and abound in it as the good Corn; and at length, being grown ripe for the Glories and Felicities of Heaven, be gather'd in Peace, and laid up in Repoſitories of eternal Reſt and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as in the bleſſed <hi>Garner of our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, this Parable informs us of the Time of <hi>Diſcovery</hi> of the Tares, the <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical</hi> Religioniſts; namely, the Time of <hi>bringing forth Fruit:</hi> When the Blade was <hi>ſprung</hi> up and brought forth <hi>Fruit,</hi> or when the <hi>Grain</hi> appear'd in the Ear, <hi>then</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd the Tares alſo. <hi>Then</hi> appear'd the Difference between the <hi>good Corn</hi> and the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103289:39"/>
               <hi>Cockle,</hi> which at firſt coming up look'd as flouriſhing and promis'd as fair as the good Corn; but when the Time drew nigh that the <hi>Corn</hi> ſhould appear and come to Ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Perfection, then there was a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Diſparity, and what appear'd ſo well at firſt was then found to be an <hi>empty noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Weed.</hi> And thus it is too often in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Many Men make a fair Shew and <hi>Semb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance</hi> of Piety; attend the Place of divine Worſhip, with much ſeeming Seriouſneſs and Devotion; and to all outward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, liſten to the Sermons of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and beg the divine Aid (as that Dew of Heaven, which alone can make 'em fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) as earneſtly as others do: And this <hi>looks</hi> very well, and is (as far as Men or Angels can diſcern for the preſent) as hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Beginning as need be deſir'd. The <hi>really</hi> good Seed can ſend forth nothing more promiſing at firſt; and hitherto the Tares grow <hi>undiſcover'd</hi> among the Wheat, by any Eye but that of God.</p>
            <p>But after this firſt <hi>Blade</hi> has appear'd, and that for ſome conſiderable Time; after they have begun to make this <hi>Shew</hi> of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; inſtead of advancing further and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Perfection,</hi> as the good Seed does, and abounding in every good Work like the full Grain in the Ear; theſe have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a <hi>Blade</hi> and <hi>Stalk</hi> of Religion, no <hi>Fruit</hi> appears, there is no no <hi>real ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Vertue</hi> attends this <hi>Shew</hi> of Piety,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103289:40"/>but rather the Works of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcernable in their Lives and Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And this is a plain Diſcovery to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others, that they are but <hi>formal,</hi> not <hi>ſincere</hi> Chriſtians; vile unhappy <hi>Tares,</hi> but not <hi>good Seed; for every Tree is known by its Fruits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, let no Man flatter himſelf with vain Hopes from a formal <hi>cuſtomary</hi> Religion, when there are no real <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> but on the contrary, much Wickedneſs and Folly and Vanity; for, unleſs his Religion makes him <hi>grow</hi> in <hi>Grace</hi> and Vertue, and is ſeen in <hi>all</hi> his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, 'twill be to no purpoſe to make an hypocritical Shew of it at Church; and is no better than the moſt provoking <hi>Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery</hi> of God, and an unnatural <hi>ſtarving</hi> of the Soul with ſuch <hi>fantaſtick</hi> Food, and will conſign to the loweſt Hell, which is the Portion of Hypocrites.</p>
            <p>And as a hypocritical Religion will have a very ſad Conſequence in the <hi>other</hi> World, ſo it expoſes Men to much <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> in <hi>this.</hi> For every Man that ſees ſuch great Shews of Religion, ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Chriſtian Vertue, will naturally expect to find the Man <hi>all of a Piece,</hi> and that to his <hi>Devotion</hi> and Shew of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> at <hi>Church,</hi> be added <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> in his Converſation and Intercourſe with Men. As when Men ſee the firſt Sproutings and Flouriſhing of a Field that was ſown with good Grain, they expect
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103289:40"/>to find Increaſe of the ſame good Fruits. But, when after all this fair and florid Shew of Piety and Goodneſs, there appears no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Tares,</hi> and the Man is over run with wicked Habits and vile Affections, little or no Sign of a real <hi>Senſe</hi> of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon his Mind, but rather the hidden Works of <hi>Diſhoneſty</hi> in his Dealings; <hi>Lying and Colluſion</hi> inſtead of <hi>Sincerity and Truth;</hi> Lewdneſs and Intemperance, Pride and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, inſtead of Purity both of Fleſh and Spirit: When ſuch <hi>Vileneſs</hi> as this treads upon the Heels of a Mans Shew of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, any Man may diſcern that he is a <hi>chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Phariſee,</hi> like a whited Sepulchre, beautiful <hi>without,</hi> but <hi>within</hi> full of Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs and all Uncleanneſs; that his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is <hi>confin'd</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> whither he goes ſometimes for Faſhion's Sake to <hi>viſit</hi> it, but always leaves it there <hi>behind</hi> him, and will not be troubl'd with its Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>abroad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, ſuch Hypocriſy as this, is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of the moſt <hi>hateful</hi> things in the World, and inſtead of gaining <hi>Reputation</hi> to a Man, is the ready Way to make him a <hi>common Scorn:</hi> Men can't but <hi>diſcover</hi> the abominable Cheat, and they can't but <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>deteſt</hi> it. Tares <hi>will</hi> at length ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be Tares, and the ſooner for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the good Corn. 'Tis therefore certainly the greateſt Folly in the World, to pretend to conceal under a fair Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, what will in a very ſhort Time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103289:41"/>it <hi>ſelf,</hi> and will bring a Man to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Shame and Hatred in this World, and the Flames of Hell in the next. And it concerns every Man that deſires to be happy either here or hereafter, to lay aſide all <hi>Guile</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> in Religion, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely endeavour after the <hi>Power</hi> of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs as well as put on the <hi>Form</hi> and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of it. And thus much for the third Part of this Parable, <hi>viz. when the Blade was ſprung up and brought forth Fruit, then appear'd the Tares alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next thing it informs us of, is the holy <hi>Angels</hi> Obſervation of the Actions of Men, eſpecially of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and Watchfulneſs in doing God Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and Zeal for his Glory: For thus 'tis ſaid, <hi>the Servants of the Houſholder,</hi> that is, the <hi>Angels,</hi> as 'tis in the Interpretation, <hi>came and ſaid unto him, Sir, didſt thou not ſow good Seed in thy Field? From whence then hath it Tares? He ſaid an Enemy hath done this.</hi> They anſwer'd, <hi>wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</hi> They obſerv'd by the looſe Lives of ſome Profeſſors that there were very ill Men that went under the Notion of Chriſtians; which they knew would reflect <hi>Diſhonour</hi> upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> the great Planter of that holy Religion, and would be injurious to the <hi>Progreſs</hi> of the Goſpel; and therefore they haſte to tell him that they may have his further Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and with <hi>Zeal</hi> for his <hi>Glory,</hi> and Intentions of great <hi>Charity</hi> to us poor <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:103289:41"/>they offer their beſt Endeavours to rid the Church of thoſe ſcandalous hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Members.</p>
            <p>That the bleſſed <hi>Angels,</hi> are, by God's Appointment, Obſervers, and that for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Purpoſes, of the Lives and Actions of Mankind, eſpecially of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, not only from this Part of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but from many other Places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as an attentive Reader of the holy Writings muſt often have obſerv'd: Of which, ſome few of the new Teſtament only that give moſt Light to this Matter, I ſhall at preſent mention. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10. giving Directions for the more decent Service of God in the Church; for this Reaſon ſays he, according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of that Time, ought Women to be <hi>veil'd</hi> or <hi>cover'd</hi> (as the true Senſe of the Place is) in their publick religious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, becauſe of <hi>the Angels:</hi> That is, leſt any thing indecent ſhould be obſerv'd by thoſe pure Spirits, who are preſent as God's <hi>Spies</hi> upon the Actions of Men. The laſt Verſe of the 1ſt. Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is likewiſe very plain to this Purpoſe, where the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the <hi>Angels, Are they not all</hi> ſays he, (as aſſur'd of the Truth of what he ſaid) <hi>Are they not all miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to miniſter to them who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation?</hi> That is, to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their Behaviour in the World, in order to prevent their running into Courſes ruinous, and to ſhield 'em from
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103289:42"/>the miſchievous Aſſaults of wicked Spirits. And, to mention but one Place more, St. <hi>Paul</hi> charges <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.21. <hi>Before, or as in the Preſence of God and of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and of the elect Angels,</hi> that he would obſerve thoſe things he had taught him without Prejudice or Partiality: Which plainly ſuppoſes that there were <hi>Angels</hi> then preſent, as Obſervers and Witneſſes of what they were doing and diſcourſing.</p>
            <p>It being then thus plain from Scripture, that the <hi>bleſſed Angels</hi> are Obſervers of Mens Lives and Actions, eſpecially of thoſe of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as by God's Appointment, and as Miniſters of his divine Government; I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to make curious Enquiries into the Reaſons <hi>why</hi> God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points <hi>Angels</hi> to obſerve and miniſter to us, ſince nothing eſcapes his <hi>own all-ſeeing Eye,</hi> and his <hi>own all-mighty Arm</hi> can do whatſoever he pleaſes in Heaven and in Earth, in the Sea and in all deep Places? Nor of what Rank and <hi>Order</hi> thoſe Angels are, and how <hi>many,</hi> that are thus employ'd? And whether every Man has a <hi>particular</hi> Angel aſſign'd him, as his Guardian and the Inſpector of his Actions? Which things are too <hi>high</hi> for us <hi>Mortals,</hi> we cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto them: But ſhall make this good Uſe of this Particular relating to our Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; That ſince we are under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of ſuch <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> Spirits, and whoſe Concern for our Happineſs is very great; ſince they are Witneſſes of our moſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103289:42"/>ſecret Actions, and though <hi>inviſible</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerv'd <hi>themſelves,</hi> are <hi>our curious</hi> Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: Methinks, we that are our ſelves but in <hi>one Rank</hi> of Being <hi>below</hi> 'em <hi>here,</hi> and ſhall hereafter be <hi>equal</hi> to them, ſhould not endure to be found by 'em wallowing like <hi>Swine</hi> in the <hi>Filth</hi> of <hi>Sin, degrading</hi> our ſelves to a Level with the <hi>Beaſts</hi> that periſh, and in baſe Hypocriſy <hi>pretending</hi> to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> when indeed we act like <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels:</hi> Nay, too often, like <hi>Devils incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</hi> How do thoſe good Spirits, tho' they may <hi>pity</hi> our <hi>deplorable</hi> Condition, yet withal, <hi>deſpiſe</hi> and <hi>abominate</hi> the ſervile <hi>Baſeneſs</hi> of ſuch <hi>excellent</hi> Natures! Who, notwithſtanding they have ſuch glorious <hi>Hopes,</hi> yet quit their <hi>heavenly Reverſion,</hi> for the low Enjoyments of this <hi>contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Earth!</hi> Methinks <hi>Shame</hi> ſhould deter us from vile and impious Actions, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; and the Thoughts of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our Nature, not ſuffer us to act ſo much <hi>beneath</hi> our ſelves; and a Man not <hi>brutiſhly impudent,</hi> ſhould not endure to expoſe himſelf to the Obſervation of an <hi>Angel</hi> in ſuch <hi>vile</hi> Circumſtances, as he would be loath to be found in by any <hi>Man</hi> he reverences and reſpects, nay, by a Servant or a Child.</p>
            <p>And as the Angels are <hi>Obſervers</hi> of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Actions, ſo are they God's Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to give him account of them, not that God <hi>needs</hi> ſuch Information, for every thing lies naked and open to his own <hi>all ſeeing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103289:43"/>Eye,</hi> but for the greater Order and <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> of his Government. And this their Office, they perform with great <hi>Diligence</hi> and <hi>Watchfulneſs,</hi> and ardent <hi>Zeal</hi> for his <hi>Glory;</hi> for no ſooner were the <hi>Tares</hi> diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by 'em to be among the good Corn, the formal empty Chriſtians to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd with the ſincerely good, but they haſten to give account of it to their great Maſter, and, as not being able to indure the great Diſhonour reflected upon God and the pureſt of Religions, by their baſe Hypocriſy and impious Converſation, they offer, with his Permiſſion, to remove thoſe evil Doers, thoſe not only <hi>unprofitable,</hi> but <hi>wicked</hi> Servants, as unworthy to continue any longer in ſo <hi>ſacred</hi> a Society as that of <hi>Chriſtians. Wilt thou that we gather them up?</hi> ſay they; wilt thou permit us to <hi>weed</hi> this thy great Field of thoſe noxious Tares, to cull out the <hi>empty nominal</hi> Chriſtians, and exert that Power thou haſt given us, to their deſerved Ruin; that the Reſidue of thy Servants may ſee it and fear, and keep from their Abominations? And that thoſe bleſſed Spirits, that angelick Hoſt, is able to <hi>perform</hi> this Service, no Man can doubt that remembers how <hi>one</hi> Angel in <hi>one</hi> Night deſtroy'd all the Firſt-born in <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this <hi>their</hi> Diligence and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the Service of God, and Zeal for his Glory, ſhould put <hi>us</hi> upon a holy <hi>Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of doing <hi>God's Will on Earth, as it
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103289:43"/>is done in Heaven:</hi> That is, that we, who here on Earth,
<note place="margin">Luk. 20.36.</note> are but a <hi>little lower</hi> than the Angels, and ſhall in Heaven be <hi>equal</hi> to them; ſhould now endeavour to be as like them as we <hi>can,</hi> and with the utmoſt Chearfulneſs, Alacrity and Diligence, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Duty our great Governour has ſet us; and with a prudent Zeal endeavour in our ſeveral Stations, by <hi>diſcountenancing</hi> Vice, and <hi>encouraging</hi> and promoting <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> to the utmoſt of our Power, to advance the Glory of God, and the Intereſt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of our holy Religion. If <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> would take due Notice of thoſe that live ſcandalouſly and wickedly, and not bear the Sword in <hi>vain,</hi> but be, as they ought to be, a <hi>Terrour</hi> to <hi>Evil-Doers,</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>encourage</hi> thoſe that do <hi>well;</hi> if the Governours of the <hi>Church,</hi> who are ſtil'd <hi>Angels</hi> in Scripture, would act like the Angels in this Parable, and curiouſly inſpect the Religion of their Charge, and by ſuch Methods as the Laws allow, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turn the Tares into good Seed (which, though impoſſible in <hi>Nature,</hi> yet <hi>may be,</hi> and I hope, often <hi>is</hi> done in <hi>Religion</hi>) or pluck 'em up, if ſtubborn and irreclaimable; if Governours of <hi>private Families,</hi> warm'd with the like holy Zeal, would take the like Meaſures, and either <hi>reform</hi> their ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious Servants and Dependents, or elſe rid themſelves of 'em, and bring 'em to due legal Puniſhment: If this wholeſome Courſe were taken with due <hi>Diligence,

            <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> thing this Parable informs us of, is the Reaſon why God will not <hi>ſuffer</hi> the Angels as <hi>yet</hi> to <hi>gather out</hi> the Tares from among the good Seed, to diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Hypocritical from ſincere Chriſtians, and give them their due Puniſhment; namely, <hi>leſt while they gather up the Tares, they root up alſo the Wheat with them;</hi> and therefore he ſuffers <hi>both to grow together until the Harveſt.</hi> That is, in other Words, the Reaſon of God's <hi>Forbearance</hi> of the <hi>Wicked,</hi> and not ſuffering the Angels, thoſe Miniſters of his Juſtice, to puniſh them in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103289:44"/>
               <hi>this</hi> World according to what they <hi>deſerve;</hi> is his great Care and Tenderneſs, even of the <hi>temporal</hi> Quiet and Safety of the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi> Which, by Reaſon of their <hi>Intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> with the <hi>wicked</hi> here, would at <hi>leaſt</hi> be very much <hi>diſturb'd</hi> through the root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a wicked Generation; and without the Help of a Miracle, many a <hi>good</hi> Man might periſh in ſo great a Ruin. But Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles we find God has never thought fit to work, but upon urgent <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> when his own <hi>Glory,</hi> and the Intereſt of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> cannot <hi>otherwiſe</hi> be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd; now there being <hi>no</hi> ſuch <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of puniſhing the wicked by deſtroying 'em in <hi>this</hi> World, nor conſequently of <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly preſerving</hi> thoſe that are truly good from a general Ruin; for the End of the World, that great Day of Recompence, is not far off, and both may live together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till then; God, for the Sake of the ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, leſt <hi>the Rod of the wicked ſhould come into the Lot of the righteous,</hi> does <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally</hi> reſtrain the Zeal of thoſe bleſſed Spirits the Angels, and forbears the Tares till that univerſal Harveſt, when the Earth ſhall be eas'd of its Burthen, and then the <hi>good Seed</hi> ſhall be gather'd together in <hi>Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and the <hi>Tares</hi> left to be <hi>conſum'd</hi> in that great Conflagration, when the World and all that remains in it ſhall be burnt up with Fire unquenchable. And when, in Caſe of almoſt a <hi>total</hi> Corruption of a City or Nation, and to ſtrike a Terror in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103289:45"/>others, and convince the obdurate World that God <hi>ſees</hi> and is able to <hi>puniſh</hi> obſtinate and irreclaimable Sinners, God thinks fit to ſuffer his bright Hoſt of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, utterly to <hi>deſtroy</hi> ſuch wicked Places as ſometimes we know he hath done; we have ſeveral Inſtances in Scripture and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hiſtories of the <hi>miraculous</hi> Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>good;</hi> and that, as the Pſalmiſt expreſſes it,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 91.</note> 
               <hi>though Thouſands have fallen by their Side</hi> the Deſtruction <hi>has not come nigh them; for he gives his Angels Charge over them, to keep 'em in all their Ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this great Care of Providence over the good, either in preſerving for their Sakes, <hi>Communities</hi> deſtin'd to Ruin, or elſe covering <hi>them</hi> under the Wings of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and ſhielding them from Danger till the Storm was over; there is an Inſtance in the 18. of <hi>Geneſis</hi> ſo very remarkable that I can't paſs it by. In the 23. Verſe of that Chapter, we find <hi>Abraham</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with God for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> (which he had reſolv'd to deſtroy for the abominable and incurable Wickedneſs that was in them) and he begins with what he thought would moſt prevail with God to ſpare the Place, and tells him the <hi>Safety</hi> of the <hi>Righteous</hi> would be hazarded, and that <hi>they</hi> would ſhare in the common Deſtruction; and therefore, leſt he ſhould ſlay the righteous with the wicked, which he knew the Judge of all the Earth would be far from doing, he pleads with him for the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103289:45"/>Sake of <hi>Fifty Righteous</hi> that ſhould be found there (a ſmall Number, one would think, and eaſie to be found in ſuch <hi>populous,</hi> though <hi>wicked Places</hi>) and at length (being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd by God's wondrous Goodneſs, who comply'd with him in every Requeſt, and as he <hi>ſunk</hi> the Number promis'd him he would not deſtroy) he, by degrees, deſcends to Ten; which was as far as ever his Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty would reach, and one would think far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſecure the moſt wicked City up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth. Peradventure <hi>Ten</hi> be found there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>And God ſaid unto him, I will not deſtroy it for Ten's Sake.</hi> Rather than thoſe <hi>Ten</hi> ſhould be in Danger of periſhing in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Ruin, he will <hi>recall</hi> the deſtroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and at leaſt <hi>reſpite</hi> the Execution of his Vengeance; and for <hi>their</hi> Sakes <hi>reprieve</hi> the condemn'd Place of their Abode. And when, through the <hi>extream</hi> Wickedneſs of thoſe Cities that <hi>ſmall</hi> Number of good Men was not found in them, and God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proceeded to ſhower down his fiery Indignation upon 'em, yet he remembers <hi>righteous Lot</hi> and his ſmall Family, and ſends two Angels to conduct 'em ſafely out of that accurſed Place, who <hi>haſten'd Lot,</hi> leſt he ſhould be conſum'd in the Iniquity of the Cities, and upon his Requeſt ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Zoar,</hi> which he fled to, and bid him make haſte thither, for that they could not do any thing till <hi>he</hi> was eſcap'd out of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; as you may read <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.22.</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:103289:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>And what a boundleſs Ocean is the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God! That he ſhould, not only ſo graciouſly accept the <hi>imperfect</hi> Services of his own People, as to take <hi>them</hi> into his peculiar Care and Protection; but for their <hi>Sakes</hi> likewiſe (that Deſtruction might not ſo much as come <hi>nigh</hi> their Dwellings) to ſpare <hi>thoſe</hi> that have juſtly <hi>merited</hi> the ſevereſt Expreſſes of his <hi>Diſpleaſure!</hi> This does indeed verify the Words of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, that his <hi>Mercy is over all his Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this, as it ſhould be a new Motive and Encouragement to <hi>true</hi> Holineſs, which will be ſo great a Security in perillous Times both to our ſelves and others; and demonſtrates the great <hi>Ingratitude</hi> and <hi>Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> in hating and deſpiſing and afflicting the good, who yet are as ſo many <hi>guardian Angels</hi> to it, and ſhield it from the Expreſſes of God's juſt <hi>Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:</hi> So it will ſilence that <hi>Objection</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Providence,</hi> drawn from the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Safety and Proſperity of the wicked, notwithſtanding their living in open <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> of God and his Commands. For we ſee, they are but <hi>repriev'd</hi> for the Sake of the righteous, leſt <hi>they</hi> ſhould be involv'd in the Ruin pour'd upon the ungodly: Their Puniſhment is but <hi>reſpited</hi> for a <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> while, and at the great Aſſize God's Juſtice will have its full Courſe, and ſink 'em into everlaſting Ruin. And, as the <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman</hi> may <hi>obſerve</hi> the Tares are among his good Corn, and reſolve at length to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103289:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>bind 'em up in Bundles and burn them, though his prudential Care of the good Corn inclines him to let them alone till the <hi>Harveſt,</hi> and not pluck 'em up whilſt the good Corn is ſtanding and growing to Perfection, leſt <hi>it</hi> be rooted up together with them: So <hi>God ſees</hi> and reſolves in due Time to <hi>puniſh</hi> according to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit the vile hypocritical Chriſtians, but in a wiſe and tender Regard for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>ſincerely</hi> good, <hi>with-holds</hi> his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments during their Abode in the World, but will ſurely repay the wicked Wretches what they have deſerv'd, in the great Day of <hi>Recompence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this brings me to the <hi>laſt</hi> thing this Parable informs us of, namely, that though theſe vile unhappy Tares are forborn for a while, and let paſs without bearing any publick Marks of God's Diſpleaſure <hi>here;</hi> yet there ſhall moſt certainly be a Time of Diſcrimination, even at the great <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>For, then will the great Husbandman the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> as at the Time of Harveſt, ſay to his angelical Reapers, <hi>gather ye firſt together the Tares, and bind them in Bundles to burn them, but gather the Wheat into my Barn.</hi> And accordingly they ſhall gather out of his Kingdom all that have been a <hi>Scandal</hi> to it, and under the Diſguiſe of Chriſtianity <hi>have done Iniquity,</hi> and <hi>ſhall

            <p>That is, when the <hi>Cloſe</hi> of the World ſhall come, and the whole intelligent Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation be met together at the Summons of the <hi>Trump of God; Men</hi> to receive their ſeveral <hi>Sentences,</hi> whether of <hi>Abſolution</hi> or <hi>Condemnation,</hi> according to their ſeveral Deſerts; and <hi>Angels</hi> to execute theſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences: Then ſhall the <hi>ſincerely good</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>indeed</hi> and in Truth, be plac'd by the bleſſed Angels of God on the <hi>right</hi> Hand of the <hi>glorious and juſt</hi> Judg, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Diſplay of their excellent Piety and Charity to all the World, hear this joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sound, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom prepar'd for you from the Foundation of the World;</hi> and then, be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <hi>caught up into the Clouds to meet their dear Lord in the Air, and from thenceforth be for ever with him; and ſhine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father,</hi> having Crowns of <hi>eternal Glory</hi> plac'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>Heads,</hi> and loud and rapturous <hi>Halleluja's</hi> in their <hi>Mouths:</hi> Whilſt thoſe miſerable Wretches, that knew no more of Chriſtianity than the <hi>Name,</hi> in whom Religion was only Shew and <hi>Formality,</hi> having no real Influence upon thir <hi>Lives,</hi> and bringing forth no <hi>Fruits</hi> of Piety, whilſt <hi>theſe,</hi> ſhall find to their <hi>Confuſion,</hi> that God is not to be <hi>mock'd,</hi> and be plac'd on the

            </p>
            <p>Then will the good find by a <hi>happy</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that there is indeed a <hi>Reward for the Righteous,</hi> and that, however they were <hi>laugh'd</hi> at and <hi>diſcourag'd here, their Labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> And then will the Mock Hypocritical Chriſtians be ſadly aſſur'd, notwithſtanding all their Plea of having eaten and drank in the Preſence of the Judge and at his Table, and of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taught in their Streets; that without <hi>real</hi> and ſubſtantial <hi>Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> And inſtead of being receiv'd into their Maſter's Joy, for <hi>cringing</hi> and <hi>fawning</hi> upon him, and giving him magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Titles, <hi>Lord, Lord, Jeſus, Saviour,</hi> but heeding little his Commandments; they ſhall be rejected with <hi>I know you not, depart from me ye Workers of Iniquity.</hi>

            <p>And now for a <hi>Concluſion</hi> of the whole Matter: Since from this Parable of our Lord's, it appears, that though an <hi>empty Shew</hi> of Religion may paſs well enough in <hi>this</hi> World, and meet with no open Diſcrimination or Puniſhment from God <hi>here;</hi> yet there ſhall moſt certainly be an <hi>after</hi> Reckoning, when all the <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Intentions</hi> of Men's Hearts ſhall be <hi>reveal'd,</hi> and their vile <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> and <hi>ſecret</hi> Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty laid <hi>open</hi> before <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> and an <hi>irreverſible</hi> Doom of greateſt Severity pay'd upon them according to their Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings: Since <hi>this</hi> is true, it nearly concerns us all to be Chriſtians in <hi>Reality,</hi> as well as in <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Appearance;</hi> to obey the <hi>Commands</hi> of Chriſt, as well as call him <hi>Lord,</hi> and to approve our ſelves true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples of this holy Inſtitution, by leading our Lives <hi>in all holy Converſation and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs;</hi> diligently endeavouring <hi>to be found of this great Judg in Peace, without Spot and blameleſs.</hi> Remembring <hi>that God ſhall bring every Work into Judgment, with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            </p>
            <p>Such great things as theſe being ſpoken of Religion, by thoſe that beſt knew its Excellency; and the World being ſo very backward in the Belief of their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſo fooliſh as to prefer every <hi>little</hi> worldly Good before this ineſtimable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to which, all that the <hi>whole Creation</hi> can afford is not comparable; and the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence</hi> of this Deluſion being ſo <hi>fatal,</hi> no leſs than the eternal Ruin of both Body and Soul: It highly concerns us by due Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to rectify our Apprehenſions in this Matter, and no longer childiſhly doat upon empty <hi>Gayes</hi> and Trifles, and neglect what is of infinite Excellency, and the moſt <hi>ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> Good.</p>

            <p>It is therefore the Deſign of this Diſcourſe upon the Parable above recited, to weigh the Excellency of <hi>Religion</hi> againſt all that the <hi>World</hi> can afford in the Ballance of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> that upon a fair Experiment we may ſee which does preponderate, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be <hi>convinc'd</hi> which of the Two is moſt <hi>worthy</hi> our <hi>Choice:</hi> And then, if we ſtill retain our Affection for the <hi>World</hi> againſt the Judgment of our <hi>Reaſon</hi> in behalf of <hi>Religion;</hi> we ſhall likewiſe be convinc'd that we act more like <hi>Brutes</hi> than <hi>Men,</hi> and that we deſerve to feel the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of our unreaſonable and wicked Choice, and taſte no other Happineſs than what this <hi>unſatisfying empty World</hi> can afford; and in the next World be for ever <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> becauſe we <hi>would</hi> not be for ever <hi>happy</hi> when we <hi>might.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, let us ſee what the <hi>Whole</hi> that this <hi>World</hi> can afford will amount to. All that is in the World, St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>is the Luſt of the Fleſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Eph. 2.16.</note> 
               <hi>the Luſt of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life; i. e.</hi> to theſe Three may be reduc'd the Whole of what is valuable in the World: And by the <hi>Luſt of the Fleſh</hi> is meant <hi>Pleaſure of</hi> all Sorts; by the <hi>Luſt of the Eye Riches,</hi> great <hi>Plenty</hi> and <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;</hi> and by the <hi>Pride of Life, Honour, Power</hi> and <hi>Dominion.</hi> This is that <hi>Trinity</hi> which the generality of Men adore, and impatiently deſire and place their greateſt Happineſs in the Enjoyment of; and of each of theſe Particulars, we will now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103289:52"/>what they amount to, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what is the Sum total of the World.</p>
            <p>And firſt, to obſerve the Apoſtles Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, we will begin with the <hi>Luſts of the Fleſh,</hi> or the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of the World, and which are generally <hi>firſt</hi> in Men's Eſteem, and for which they are often content to part with the other Two. Now theſe may be rank'd in this Order, <hi>viz.</hi> the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>Luſt</hi> and Uncleanneſs, of luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Eating and Drinking,</hi> and of great <hi>Jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Mirth;</hi> all agreeing in the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the Luſts of the Fleſh, that is, all highly gratefull to the Deſires and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of the Body. And in the firſt Place I obſerve this in general of all worldly Pleaſures, that the longer a Man <hi>lives</hi> to enjoy them, the more <hi>inſipid</hi> ſtill they grow to him; and that, not only upon Account of their own <hi>empty Nature,</hi> but by Reaſon of the Decays of our own <hi>Faculties,</hi> and conſequent <hi>Diſability</hi> to enjoy them. As old <hi>Barzillai</hi> ſaid to <hi>David;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 19.35.</note> 
               <hi>Can I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between Good and Evil?</hi> &amp;c. when he invited him to the Pleaſures of his Court. And what Happineſs can be expected from that which is very unſatisfying in its own Nature, and which, were it <hi>not</hi> after a few Years we ſhall be incapable of enjoying? But to be more <hi>particular:</hi> As for the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>Luſt and Uncleanneſs;</hi> whatever Men's <hi>Expectations</hi> may be of receiving great Satisfaction from them, they can't but find by their Experience, that there is much of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103289:53"/>
               <hi>Diſappointment</hi> in 'em, and the Pleaſure much greater in <hi>Imagination</hi> than <hi>Reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> They are indeed <hi>deceitful</hi> Luſts, and often make Men <hi>miſerable,</hi> even <hi>here,</hi> but never happy. And for the Truth of this (that it may not be look'd upon as a thing only <hi>ſaid,</hi> not <hi>prov'd,</hi> and the cinical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of a frozen diſpirited Student, whoſe narrow Courſe of Life has made him a Stranger to ſuch Sort of Enjoyments, and caus'd him to give a worſe Character of them than they deſerve) I ſhall vouch the Teſtimony of <hi>Solomon;</hi> who fill'd the Throne of a rich and flouriſhing Kingdom, and was accountable to none but <hi>God</hi> for Actions of this Nature, and his Deſires perfectly without any <hi>humane</hi> Reſtraint; and who made it his Buſineſs to find out what was the greateſt Happineſs of Man in this World, and <hi>whatſoever his Eyes deſir'd he kept not from them; he with-held not his Heart from any Joy;</hi> and who, amongſt other Delights, had great Numbers of <hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Concubines,</hi> to the Number of <hi>Seven Hundred Wives</hi> that were <hi>Princeſſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 11.3.</note> and <hi>Three Hundred Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines,</hi> and theſe the faireſt, doubtleſs, that could be met with: Variety enough, one would think, to take off all Poſſibility of <hi>loathing</hi> and Deſire of <hi>Change.</hi> But now, what ſays <hi>Solomon</hi> after ſo <hi>full</hi> and <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul'd</hi> Enjoyment of theſe carnal Pleaſures? Why truly in the very Beginning of his Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> Chap. 2.18, 19. he tells the World, that the <hi>Houſe of the Strange,</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:103289:53"/>or Whoriſh <hi>Woman inclineth unto Death, and her Paths unto the Dead: None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the Paths of Life.</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.3. <hi>The Lips of a ſtrange Woman drop as an hony Comb, and her Mouth is ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Oyl; but her End,</hi> or the End of having to do with her, <hi>is bitter as Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, ſharp as a two edged Sword.</hi> Very frequent are his Invectives againſt this Vice, and deliver'd with more than ordinary Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs: And in the 7th. Chapter of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes</hi> (the Book of his Recantations) he publickly declares, that he <hi>finds</hi> (as by his own <hi>Experience) He finds more bitter than Death, the Woman whoſe Heart is Snares and her Hands as Bands; whoſo pleaſeth God ſhall eſcape from her, but the Sinner ſhall be taken by her.</hi> Verſ. 26. As if 'twere a <hi>peculiar</hi> Providence of God, to protect a <hi>good</hi> Man from falling into ſo great a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and that he ſuffers the wicked to be enſnar'd by it as a ſevere Puniſhment and great Expreſſion of his <hi>Diſpleaſure.</hi> And in the next Verſe, <hi>Behold, ſays the Preacher, this have I found, counting one by one to find out the Account, which yet my Soul ſeeketh, but I find not: One Man among a Thouſand have I found, but a Woman among all thoſe have I not found.</hi> That is, he did at laſt meet with a <hi>Man</hi> that anſwer'd his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations as a Friend or faithful Servant: But among all his <hi>Concubines,</hi> not <hi>one</hi> but who baulk'd and diſappointed his fond Hopes of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103289:54"/>Happineſs from the Enjoyment of her, and <hi>depriv'd</hi> him of more Satisfaction than ſhe gave him.</p>
            <p>And thus we ſee, from the Confeſſion of <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf, who gratified his <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Appetite to the <hi>full,</hi> and experienc'd the utmoſt of what <hi>Luſt</hi> and <hi>Wantonneſs</hi> could afford; that this Sort of Pleaſure amounts to no more than this, <hi>Diſhonour</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment</hi> always, and not ſeldom <hi>Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now proceed to enquire what the Pleaſures of <hi>luxurious Eating,</hi> and <hi>intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Drinking</hi> will amount to. All that it can <hi>pretend</hi> to is the Gratification of the <hi>Taſte</hi> and <hi>Palate:</hi> For, as for true <hi>Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> High Feeding falls far ſhort of more <hi>ordinary</hi> Diet; and as for refreſhing and <hi>cheriſhing</hi> the Spirits, a <hi>moderate</hi> Quantity of Wine is ſufficient, and what is more than <hi>that,</hi> ends in a Fit of Madneſs, and <hi>impoveriſhes</hi> Nature. Now, the Pleaſures of the <hi>Palate</hi> make the <hi>beſt</hi> of them, are of very <hi>ſhort</hi> Continuance, no ſooner taſted but they vaniſh; and the Stomach will not <hi>bear</hi> a long <hi>Repetition</hi> of this Pleaſure, and is ſooneſt <hi>cloy'd</hi> and <hi>ſurfeited</hi> with what is of the <hi>richeſt</hi> Guſt and Reliſh: And the <hi>Inconveniences</hi> that attend this <hi>ſhort-liv'd</hi> and very <hi>imperfect</hi> Pleaſure, are <hi>great</hi> and of very <hi>long</hi> Continuance. For, ſuppoſe a Mans Revenues to be ſo large that he can bear the <hi>Expence</hi> of Luxury, without weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Fortune</hi> in the leaſt, and ſo that very
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103289:54"/>
               <hi>uſual</hi> ill Conſequence of it, cannot in this Caſe be charg'd upon it, yet others full as great may. As firſt, the more a Man <hi>indulges</hi> his Palate, the harder he will find it to be pleas'd, and at length 'twill grow ſo <hi>troubleſomely</hi> nice, that its <hi>Diſguſts</hi> will be more frequent than its <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> and ſo, inſtead of procuring a conſtant <hi>Gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of the Palate, Luxury is the ready Way to make a Man <hi>diſreliſh</hi> almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing: Which muſt needs make his Life a continual <hi>Vexation</hi> and Uneaſineſs; and a <hi>Plowman</hi> with his coarſe Fare, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Sauce</hi> to it but a <hi>good Stomach,</hi> will experience far greater and more <hi>laſting</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in <hi>eating and drinking,</hi> than the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Epicure</hi> in the World. And therefore, Luxury is indeed the <hi>wrong</hi> Way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an intire Gratification of the Palate, and <hi>deſtroys</hi> what it pretends to <hi>create.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other very ill Conſequence of Luxury is, that it mightily weakens and <hi>impairs Health,</hi> and makes a Man a <hi>living Hoſpital,</hi> full of Diſeaſes, and very often cuts his Days off in the <hi>Midſt.</hi> And thus does an <hi>over-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence</hi> to the Body cruciate and deſtroy it, and by an extravagant Care to <hi>pleaſe</hi> the Palate, Men bring upon themſelves a Neceſſity of taking ſuch <hi>medicinal</hi> Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as are abundantly more <hi>nauſeous</hi> to it, than ever the moſt artificial Diſhes or richeſt Wines were <hi>grateful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by this Time we perceive what lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious Eating and drinking amounts to;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103289:55"/>truly no more than this, a very <hi>ſhort im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Pleaſure,</hi> attended with <hi>great</hi> and <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ill Conſequences,</hi> which abundantly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh the <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and would do ſo were it <hi>Greater</hi> and more <hi>laſting</hi> than it is.</p>
            <p>Another Deſire of the Fleſh is <hi>Mirth and Jollity,</hi> a thoughtleſs Courſe of Life, ſpent in <hi>Recreations,</hi> in Laughter, and an <hi>aery</hi> facetious Way of Converſation; and this is very taking with Abundance of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and he counted the happieſt Man that can ſpend his Days in this Manner, and has little elſe to do. Well then, ſuppoſe a Man ſo intirely diſengag'd from the Fatigues of Buſineſs, as to have his Time wholly at his own Diſpoſal; ſuppoſe him to be of a brisk lively Temper, and free from all Care and Trouble, and that he has the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of ſuch as are as ſprightly as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo that the Day ſeems too ſhort for their Mirth and Pleaſantry, their Paſtimes and Recreations: Suppoſe all this, that is, ſuppoſe a Man to have all of this Kind of Pleaſure that the World can afford, we ſhall find upon a nearer View, that there is as great an <hi>Alloy</hi> here as in the Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before mention'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was a very competent Judg in this Matter, and for a conſiderable Time made Jollity his <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> and taſted as much of it as 'tis poſſible for a Man to do; was ſo much of this Mind, as to pronounce it not only <hi>Vanity,</hi> but <hi>Vexation of Spirit.</hi> He gave himſelf wholly up to <hi>Mirth</hi> (as
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103289:55"/>he tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.1. &amp;c.) and the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of <hi>Wine,</hi> with <hi>agreeable Company:</hi> He planted beautiful Gardens, Vineyards and Groves, interwoven with artificial Streams; to improve the Reliſh of thoſe his Delights; and as the Crown of all, he had all Sorts of <hi>Muſick</hi> attending him, both vocal and inſtrumental; ſo that he had what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Heart could deſire to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf happy this Way if this could do it. And what was the Reſult of all this? Why truly, a few ſerious reflecting Thoughts diſcover'd to him, that <hi>All was but Vanity and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit. I ſaid of Laughter, it is mad, and of Mirth, what doth it?</hi> And what doth it indeed? 'Tis <hi>profitable</hi> for nothing, and when <hi>exceſſive,</hi> and attended too <hi>extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly,</hi> 'tis <hi>naturally</hi> as well as <hi>morally</hi> an Evil; It <hi>unmans</hi> and effeminates the <hi>Soul,</hi> and <hi>diſpirits</hi> and hebetates the <hi>Body.</hi> The moſt <hi>profuſe Laughter</hi> ends in a <hi>Sigh,</hi> and <hi>Uneaſineſs,</hi> and looks much like <hi>Madneſs,</hi> and is a certain Indication of <hi>Folly.</hi> A <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent chearfulneſs</hi> is commendable upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Accounts; but to make a <hi>Trade</hi> of Jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to be always upon the <hi>Laugh,</hi> and ſpend the <hi>greateſt</hi> Part of a Man's <hi>Time</hi> in Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations and <hi>Diverſions;</hi> as 'tis a very <hi>childiſh</hi> thing, and looks much like the Behaviour of <hi>Naturals</hi> and <hi>Changelings,</hi> ſo 'tis a very <hi>uneaſie</hi> thing too, and grows from a <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> into a <hi>Toil</hi> and <hi>Burthen.</hi> Witneſs ſuch Perſons frequent ſhifting and <hi>changing</hi> one Diverſion for another, how at a <hi>Loſs</hi> ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are, how to diſpoſe of their
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103289:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>Time, and what Sport to go to next, and how quickly <hi>tir'd</hi> they are with their idle Employment? And, it may be very truly ſaid, there is <hi>leſs</hi> of Pleaſure in a Courſe of Life that is always <hi>hunting</hi> after Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and intent upon nothing elſe, than in a more ſevere ſerious Way of living, which <hi>but now and then,</hi> and <hi>ſparingly,</hi> taſtes of Mirth and Recreations, and ſoon returns to things of more Weight and Concern. And the Reaſon is, thoſe <hi>light</hi> Sort of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments are ſo empty of what will grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy a <hi>rational Soul,</hi> that they preſently grow <hi>flat</hi> and <hi>inſipid,</hi> and become <hi>tedious</hi> rather than <hi>diverting,</hi> when <hi>too long</hi> dwelt upon, and ſuck'd too <hi>dry.</hi> A <hi>ſhort tranſient</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment is moſt agreeable to their <hi>fading,</hi> periſhing Nature; and as he enjoys the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancy of a <hi>Roſe</hi> both <hi>more</hi> and <hi>longer,</hi> who ſmells of it <hi>gently</hi> and with frequent <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions,</hi> than he that uſes it more <hi>roughly,</hi> and preſſes it too <hi>conſtantly</hi> and too <hi>hard;</hi> ſo he experiences much <hi>more</hi> of the <hi>Sweet</hi> of <hi>Mirth and Pleaſantry;</hi> who but <hi>ſeldom</hi> and <hi>moderately</hi> uſes it, than he that makes it his <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> and follows it as <hi>cloſe</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do their <hi>Callings.</hi> Even in <hi>Laughter</hi> (when extravagant) ſays the wiſe King, <hi>The Heart is ſorrowful,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.2.</note> 
               <hi>and the End of that Mirth is Heavineſs:</hi> Nay, he ſays, <hi>'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to go to the Houſe of Mourning than to the Houſe of Feaſting;</hi> for that may have ſome ſubſtantial <hi>good Effect</hi> upon a Man, <hi>Death being the End of all Men,</hi> and the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103289:56"/>
               <hi>living,</hi> at ſuch ſerious Times, may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to <hi>lay it to Heart;</hi> whereas <hi>Jollity</hi> and <hi>Mirth</hi> wholly evaporate into <hi>Folly,</hi> and leave nothing behind them that is any Way <hi>profitable,</hi> unleſs it be <hi>Repentance.</hi> Sorrow and Seriouſneſs make Men <hi>conſider,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come receptive of wiſe Inſtructions; but a light, <hi>frothy</hi> Temper, both <hi>expoſes</hi> a Man's Folly, and fatally prevents his growing <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer:</hi> It ſhews that he <hi>is</hi> a Fool, and that he is like to <hi>continue,</hi> ſo. For, <hi>as the crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Thorns under a Pot, ſo is the Laughter of a Fool;</hi> there is much of <hi>Noiſe</hi> in it, but it ſerves to no other Purpoſe than to <hi>ſhame himſelf.</hi> And thus we have ſeen what the Heigth of <hi>Mirth and Jollity</hi> amounts to; namely, <hi>Diſappointment, Vexation and Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieneſs, Shame</hi> and <hi>Vanity, Madneſs</hi> and <hi>Folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus ſumm'd up the true Value of <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Three</hi> things in which conſiſts the Happineſs of the World, the <hi>Luſts of the Fleſh,</hi> or thoſe things which more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately gratifie our <hi>bodily Appetites;</hi> let us now look into the</p>

               <hi>Second,</hi> which is call'd by the Apoſtle, the <hi>Luſt of the Eyes;</hi> that is, <hi>Riches</hi> and great Abundance of <hi>this World's Good,</hi> ſuch as <hi>ample Poſſeſſions, magnificent Structures, a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Equipage, glorious Apparel,</hi> and the like: Which are call'd the <hi>Luſts of the Eyes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis the Senſe of <hi>ſeeing</hi> that theſe things affect with the greateſt Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Now, ſuppoſe a Man to have <hi>all</hi> of this Nature that the <hi>World</hi> can help him to;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103289:57"/>ſuppoſe he has Riches enough to anſwer all theſe things, to <hi>provide</hi> all this Splendor and Magnificence, and to <hi>ſupport</hi> and <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> it: What more will it amount to, than, as <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſſes it,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.11.</note> 
               <hi>the beholding of it with our Eyes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, as for great Treaſures of <hi>Gold and Silver,</hi> though they may procure many things to delight the <hi>Eye</hi> and pleaſe the <hi>Fancy,</hi> yet the Man that hath 'em remains ſtill as <hi>Nature made him,</hi> none of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or Faculties either of his Soul or Body receive any <hi>Improvement</hi> nor Alteration un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be for the <hi>worſe.</hi> But Mony will erect <hi>magnificent</hi> and ſtately <hi>Buildings,</hi> 'twill purchaſe <hi>rich Furniture,</hi> and all that Art can do to adorn and beautify them. 'Tis true, it will ſo; but, will thoſe ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Structures preſerve a Man better from the Injuries of the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Weather</hi> than more ordinary Houſes? Shall a Man <hi>ſleep better</hi> in a <hi>coſtly</hi> than a <hi>meaner</hi> Bed? And, will a Fever handle him more gently that lies within Curtains of <hi>Velvet,</hi> and has his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber adorn'd in the moſt coſtly Manner, than one that is contented with a cleanly Meanneſs? If not, ſtill 'tis the <hi>Eye</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives all the <hi>Pleaſure.</hi>

            <p>As for the ſplendid <hi>Equipage</hi> of the Men of great Poſſeſſions, a Croud of Attendants following them, in gay Liyeries, glittering Coaches, and the like; this may pleaſe the <hi>Eye</hi> too; but what more does it effect? 'Tis but Two or Three of thoſe Attendants that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103289:57"/>can be <hi>ſerviceable,</hi> the reſt are own'd to be for <hi>State</hi> only, and are kept for little elſe than to eat and drink and be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; and the Experience of all Men will tell us, that he is the happieſt Man that ſtands in need of the <hi>feweſt</hi> Servants, and retains no more than he ſtands in <hi>need of.</hi> As for fine Coaches and glorious Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, if <hi>Gold</hi> upon a Coach, and <hi>coſtly Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings</hi> would make a Journy more ſafe and eaſie, and if rich Clothes would keep one <hi>Warmer,</hi> or laſt <hi>longer,</hi> or be leſs <hi>troubleſome</hi> than a more ordinary Habit, there might be ſomething ſaid for them: But, ſince there is nothing of this in them, nay, rather they are <hi>leſs</hi> ſerviceable to the Ends they were at firſt deſign'd for, and that <hi>over-Niceneſs</hi> and <hi>Curioſity</hi> in <hi>Dreſs</hi> or any thing elſe is the Occaſion of much <hi>Diſturbance</hi> and <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs:</hi> The beholding theſe gay things with the <hi>Eye,</hi> is all that is conſiderable in them. And, what does the <hi>beholding</hi> of all theſe ſplendid Sights amount to? Is there any <hi>through</hi> and <hi>laſting</hi> Pleaſure in it, any thing that will make a Man <hi>happy,</hi> or ſo much as <hi>promote</hi> his Happineſs? Why truly, <hi>Solomon,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Come we now to examin the <hi>third</hi> Part of this World's Treaſure, the <hi>Pride of Life,</hi> or, <hi>Honour, Power and Dominion.</hi> And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fitly is this ſtil'd the <hi>Pride of Life,</hi> it being the Aim of moſt men to be <hi>great,</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:103289:58"/>to <hi>command and govern,</hi> and to have much of Honour and <hi>Reſpect</hi> paid to them; and in this they <hi>pride</hi> themſelves more than in any other worldly Good that they poſſeſs. But, what is there in all this that a Man can juſtly value at ſo high a Rate? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Man to be Monarch of the <hi>whole World,</hi> to be without Controul from any one on Earth, and to give Laws to every Man beſides; ſuppoſe many inferiour Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces tributary to him, and that he is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like a mortal God; ſuppoſe all this, yet, however glorious it may appear at a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> we ſhall find, upon a cloſer Inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that <hi>this</hi> likewiſe is <hi>Vanity and Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, as for even an <hi>univerſal</hi> Dominion, unleſs the Subjects were as willing to <hi>obey,</hi> as the Monarch is deſirous to <hi>govern,</hi> a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic</hi> Crown would ſit as uneaſie, nay, <hi>more</hi> ſo, than that of leſſer Princes. The further a Man's Dominion extends, the more <hi>Difficulties</hi> in Government will occur; the more ambitious and diſcontented Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits will there be to tame and keep in order; the more ſecret Conſpiracies and Underminings of Men aggriev'd <hi>and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd,</hi> and that are as deſirous of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as he that ſits in the Throne can be: And which, will often break out to ſhake and <hi>diſcompoſe,</hi> if not to <hi>overturn</hi> the preſent Eſtabliſhment. And the more extenſive a Princes Dominions are, the more muſt there be employ'd in the Government of them,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103289:59"/>and thoſe, Men of different Intereſts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, <hi>jealous</hi> of one another, and <hi>envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> at the <hi>Supreme,</hi> and more ready to carve for themſelves and advance their own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, than ſincerely to endeavour the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of their Maſter. This is found very true, and the Occaſion of much Trouble and Diſquiet, to Princes that have Affairs more in their <hi>own View</hi> than this <hi>univerſal</hi> Monarch can be ſuppoſed to have; and therefore much more dangerouſly muſt <hi>he</hi> ſit than <hi>they,</hi> and receive much more <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude</hi> and Trouble if he takes <hi>Notice</hi> of the Motion of his great Orb; and if he does <hi>not,</hi> where is the Pleaſure of governing?</p>
            <p>So that the moſt <hi>ample</hi> Dominion is thickeſt ſet with Thorns and Briars while enjoyed, and in continual Danger of a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; which muſt perplex him that is <hi>ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of it, with numberleſs Fears and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and anxious Thoughts how to <hi>ſecure</hi> his Throne: And he that is careleſs and <hi>unſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> and leaves the Fatigues of Government to <hi>Others,</hi> and ſpends his Days in nothing but Eaſe and <hi>Luxury;</hi> is an Emperour in <hi>Title</hi> only, and may ſoon, for any thing he knows, be not ſo much as <hi>that.</hi> The <hi>one</hi> leads a Life of <hi>Vanity,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> of <hi>Vexation of Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That 'tis <hi>eaſier</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> than to <hi>govern,</hi> is an uſual and very true Saying; and would be ſo, were Thrones not near ſo <hi>ſlippery</hi> as they are; and I am ſure 'tis very much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier for a Man never to have <hi>had</hi> ſuch
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103289:59"/>Height of Power and Dominion, than ever to ſee himſelf thrown down and laid in the Duſt. The very <hi>Danger</hi> of ſo great a Fall, is enough to fill ones Breaſt with great. <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,</hi> ſo great, as that all the Gauderies of Grandeur ſhall loſe their Taſte, and become <hi>inſipid</hi> to him, and <hi>actually</hi> to fall (as many glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Princes have already done) is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Miſery that can be experienc'd upon earth.</p>
            <p>The ſhort is, Empire and Dominion, fancy it how great ſoever, is at <hi>beſt</hi> very <hi>troubleſome</hi> and <hi>diſquieting;</hi> and ſo <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> as that it not ſeldom ends in the very <hi>Depth</hi> of <hi>Ruin.</hi> And as for the <hi>Honour</hi> that goes along with it, <hi>glorious Titles, low Obeiſance,</hi> and the like; all of this Nature is ſo perfectly <hi>empty,</hi> and utterly ineffective of any thing that's truly <hi>good</hi> and <hi>Profitable</hi> to a Man, that 'tis of all things the moſt <hi>deſpicable</hi> and of leaſt Regard: And though 'tis fit Inferiours ſhould pay it where 'tis due, yet unleſs an inward Veneration of the <hi>Mind,</hi> attends that outward Reſpect of the <hi>Body,</hi> a great Man is ſo far from being <hi>honoured</hi> by it, that 'tis the greateſt <hi>Mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Abuſe</hi> that can be. And becauſe no great Man can tell whether he is <hi>inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> reverenced or no, neither can force any Man ſo to honour him againſt his Will; 'tis a very great Weakneſs for him to ſet any great <hi>Value</hi> upon <hi>outward</hi> Reſpect, which for ought he knows, nay, in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood may be, an <hi>Affront</hi> rather than an
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103289:60"/>
               <hi>Honour</hi> to him. And this is what <hi>Honour, Power</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> amount to.</p>
            <p>Having thus given in an impartial Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and that confirmed by the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who enjoy'd it all to the <hi>Full,</hi> of the Sum <hi>Total</hi> of what <hi>this World</hi> can afford, that can pretend to be of any Worth and Eſteem; by examining the Three Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in which is contained all that is valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it; namely, <hi>the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life:</hi> Let us now weigh <hi>Religion</hi> againſt it, and ſee which does <hi>preponderate,</hi> which is the moſt <hi>weighty</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Good, and conſequently, whether the <hi>Merchant</hi> in the Parable did <hi>wiſely</hi> or no, in ſelling <hi>all that he had</hi> that he might purchaſe <hi>this Pearl,</hi> and be Maſter of this <hi>Treaſure?</hi> And we ſhall conſider Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in a twofold Reſpect, with Relation to <hi>this</hi> World as well as the other.</p>
            <p>And firſt, as for the Value of Religion with Relation to <hi>this</hi> World; what is of greater Eſteem than <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Quietneſs, Contentment</hi> and Satisfaction of <hi>Mind,</hi> a <hi>Long</hi> and <hi>Healthy Life here,</hi> and a comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>expectation</hi> of a much <hi>better endleſs</hi> Life in the Regions of <hi>Glory?</hi> And all this, <hi>Religion</hi> is the only ſure Way to attain.</p>
            <p>What the World it <hi>ſelf</hi> affords we have ſeen cannot make us happy in it; its Riches, and Pleaſures, and Honours, and Power, and Dominion are empty and unſatisfying; and indeed, the Parent of nothing but <hi>Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit:</hi> And therefore I ſhall wave
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103289:60"/>the Enquiry how far Religion is conducive to <hi>theſe</hi> things; though it might be made apparent, that this is the ſureſt Way even to become <hi>rich,</hi> to live <hi>Pleaſantly,</hi> and with <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reſpect:</hi> and as for Dominion, to govern a Mans <hi>ſelf,</hi> which Religion only teaches, is more than to govern the <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, as to Peace and Quietneſs, which are Bleſſings of the firſt Magnitude, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed give a Reliſh to every thing elſe; for without them neither Riches, nor Honour, nor even Health and Life it ſelf ſits eaſie: That Religion is the only ſure Way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure theſe great Bleſſings, and that both in <hi>Private</hi> and in <hi>Publick,</hi> Abroad with others, and at Home in a Mans own Breaſt, will ſoon be evident.</p>
            <p>As for Peace and Quietneſs in our Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with <hi>others,</hi> Religion does manifeſtly tend to procure that, upon theſe two Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. (1.) Becauſe it forbids the <hi>offering</hi> any Injuries. (2) Becauſe it forbids <hi>return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> any. Now that which embroils the World, and is the Occaſion of all Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being the <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>Retaliating</hi> Harms and ill Turns, and Religion ſo ſtrictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding us to love our Neighbours as our ſelves, to do <hi>to</hi> others nothing but what in like Circumſtances we would be willing to receive <hi>from</hi> others; and to <hi>forgive</hi> if any have done injuriouſly by us, as we hope to be forgiven by God at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: 'Tis plain that were our holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſincerely embrac'd, and had its due
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103289:61"/>Influence upon the Minds of Men, the World might (in the Literal Senſe of the Words) <hi>beat their Swords into Plough-Shares, and their Spears into Pruning-Hooks, and need not learn War any more; nothing would</hi> then <hi>hurt in God's holy Mountain:</hi> And the World would be what God at firſt deſign'd it; a Paradiſe of Happineſs, and Mankind a Family of Love. And as for Peace and Quiet at <hi>Home,</hi> in a Mans own Breaſt, and without which all other Peace would loſe its Reliſh, Religion is the only Way to attain that Bleſſing. For as long as there is ſuch a thing as Conſcience (which there will be as long as a Man is in any Poſſibility of Salvation) it will do its Office freely and impartially, and laſh the Soul that ſins, as often as it ſins, and fill it full of Horror and Confuſion and dreadful Apprehenſions of the juſt Vengeance of God at the Day of Retribution. <hi>There is no Peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked; but their Souls are like the troubled Sea which cannot reſt, and whoſe Waters caſt up Mire and Dirt.</hi> But a <hi>good</hi> Mans Breaſt is quiet and ſerene, full of the Joys of Innocence, and the Applauſes of a <hi>Conſcience void of Offence both towards God and Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as Peace and Quietneſs, ſo <hi>Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Mind, is the natural Product of Religion, and of that only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Without</hi> Contentment of Mind, <hi>no</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition how good ſoever in its ſelf, is pleaſing, and <hi>with</hi> it, <hi>every</hi> Condition is: For Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103289:61"/>conſiſts in the <hi>Proportion</hi> of the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> to the <hi>Deſire,</hi> and he that has the <hi>whole</hi> of what this World can afford, if he deſires ſtill <hi>more,</hi> and thinks his preſent Condition not good enough; is by many Degrees leſs happy than he that muſt <hi>drudge</hi> for his liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but yet is <hi>contented</hi> with his Lot. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs conſiſts not in <hi>Abundance;</hi> he only is indeed a <hi>happy</hi> Man, that is ſo wiſe as to enjoy his preſent Portion, and knows how <hi>patiently</hi> to endure a <hi>worſe</hi> Condition, and dreads a baſe and wicked Action, however gainful and advantagious it may be, even worſe than Death. And he'll for ever be a Slave that can't be ſatisfied with a little.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>contented</hi> Man is always eaſy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his preſent Lot; and if his Fortune will not <hi>riſe</hi> to what he could <hi>deſire,</hi> he will bring his Deſires <hi>down</hi> to his <hi>Fortune;</hi> and ſo be ſure of Happineſs, becauſe by this means his Deſires and his Fortune bear a due Proportion to one another. And truly, ſo various are the Turns of Fortune here, ſo many unexpected Accidents that make great Changes for the worſe in Mens Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Life, and which 'tis utterly out of their Power to have any Influence upon ſo as to amend; that were there not this Remedy of making our Minds <hi>comply</hi> with the Event, and taking out the Sting and Venom of it by Acquieſcence and Contentment and <hi>Contraction</hi> of our <hi>Deſires,</hi> Man would be the moſt miſerable Creature upon the Face of the Earth. But he that has learned and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103289:62"/>can apply this Remedy, whatever he may ſuffer from without, has a Power ſtill rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of turning it into <hi>Good;</hi> and though he can't prevent the <hi>Accident,</hi> yet he can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent its doing him a <hi>Miſchief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this excellent Remedy for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of Life, Religion beſt of all teaches us. For in the firſt place it teaches us that God is the great Governour of the World, and with the exacteſt <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> diſpoſes all things; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that all Events are as they <hi>ſhould</hi> be, and upon the whole Account ordered for the <hi>Beſt:</hi> For there is no Poſſibility of <hi>amending</hi> what is done with infinite <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs.</hi> And ſecondly, it teaches us that our <hi>Intereſt</hi> does leaſt of all lie in <hi>this</hi> World, where we are but <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> and <hi>Foreigners,</hi> and are to continue but for a <hi>little while;</hi> and that our <hi>Treaſure</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi> is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> which is our native Country, and to which e're long we ſhall be recall'd, and our Glory and Happineſs there be the more increas'd, as we have more patiently and contentedly ſubmitted to God's Pleaſure here upon Earth. And a hearty thorough Perſwaſion of theſe two things, will certainly teach a Man <hi>to know,</hi> with St. <hi>Paul, How to abound and how to want, and in every Condition to be content.</hi> And for this, Chriſtianity gives the cleareſt <hi>Evidence,</hi> even the Word of God himſelf, <hi>who cannot lye;</hi> as no Man can be to learn that has read the Scriptures.</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:103289:62"/>
            <p>But <hi>Irreligion</hi> on the contrary, is the great <hi>Deſtroyer</hi> of Content, and fills the Soul with continual Vexations, and makes every croſs Accident doubly evil by Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For firſt, the ungodly have not <hi>God in all their Thoughts,</hi> are wholly taken up with <hi>ſecond Cauſes,</hi> and look upon things as the Effect of <hi>Chance</hi> and <hi>Fortune;</hi> and ſo when Croſſes come upon them, or <hi>ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> as they call it, they grow querulous and out of all Patience; and as for <hi>divine Providence,</hi> that's wholly unregarded, unleſs it be to <hi>revile</hi> it and impiouſly to call in queſtion the Goodneſs and Juſtice of its Diſpoſals. And ſo, <hi>that</hi> which in Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the greateſt Cordial of all, Irreligion ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly <hi>deprives</hi> the Soul of, or turns it into Poiſon; and inſtead of <hi>diſarming</hi> a Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune by humble Submiſſion to the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wiſe, and juſt, and good Diſpoſals of the great Governour of all things, adds a thouſand ſharper things to it, and makes that become <hi>intolerable,</hi> which Religion would have made to ſit <hi>light</hi> and <hi>eaſy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Content is deſtroyed by Irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe it perſwades Men that their whole Intereſt lies here below; either by making them believe there is no ſuch thing as another World, or elſe by engaging them ſo faſt to this, as to hinder their <hi>attending</hi> to any thing beyond this Life: And the Effect of this is great eagerneſs in acquiring theſe lower Goods, impatient Deſires of ſtill more and more of the <hi>World,</hi> as that in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103289:63"/>which is concentred their whole Happineſs. And what elſe can be the Conſequence of this amidſt the great <hi>uncertainties</hi> that attend theſe ſublunary things, but a World of Trouble and Diſcontent, anſwerable to thoſe numerous croſs Accidents and Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments which every Condition is full of from the higheſt to the loweſt? Every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Hit to ſuch Men is like a Dagger ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to the very Heart; for that which a Man looks upon as his <hi>chief Good</hi> he can by no means endure to have leſſened and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired: And the World being ſo full of ſuch vexatious Miſhaps, how full of Wounds muſt be the Spirit of an ungodly World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling!</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Content,</hi> ſo <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Mind, which is much more than a ſubmiſſive <hi>Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence</hi> in our preſent Condition, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a Happineſs that is <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>full.</hi> This is a Bleſſing which nothing but ſincere <hi>Religion</hi> can ever make the Soul experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: And he only that has learned to make <hi>God</hi> the chief Object of his Affections and Deſires, can indeed know what <hi>Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is.</p>
            <p>For every thing beſides <hi>God</hi> is unſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe flitting and momentary, and very imperfect, and empty of that infinite Good which is the only adequate Object of that infinite Deſire of Happineſs which is in the Soul of Man. This is the Reaſon that Men are ſo conſtantly <hi>diſappointed</hi> in their Expectation of Happineſs from the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103289:63"/>of this World's Good; let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually have what they deſire (which yet is too much to be rationally ſuppoſed of any Man) and enjoy it fully and without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, yet ſtill there will be ſomething <hi>want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to <hi>compleat</hi> their Happineſs, ſomething that they deſire ſtill <hi>further;</hi> and ſo the Soul is continually baulk'd of her Expectation, and ſtill at a Loſs for Happineſs, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Longings and Deſires, and as continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Diſappointments, are her Portion in this World. And what's more uneaſie and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious than ſuch a Condition as this? What more deplorable than even by Fruition it ſelf to be made unhappy? What other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge has the miſerable Soul in this Caſe, than to take off her Affections from theſe empty Nothings here below, and as Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on directs, fix them upon him who is the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Good,</hi> and will abide the Teſt of an <hi>eternal</hi> Fruition. In the Enjoyment of <hi>him</hi> muſt needs be <hi>infinite Satisfaction,</hi> becauſe there is no real Good that we can poſſibly <hi>deſire,</hi> but is in the divine Nature in the higheſt Degree of Excellency and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that not only for a <hi>Time,</hi> but to all Eternity. All the Capacities of the Soul muſt needs be <hi>fill'd</hi> with an <hi>infinite</hi> Good, and intirely reſt in it as in the very <hi>Center</hi> of Happineſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Religion is of very great Value with Reſpect to <hi>this</hi> World, becauſe 'tis ſo greatly conducive to a <hi>long</hi> and <hi>healthy Life</hi> in it.</p>

            <p>Long Life and Health is that which all People naturally covet, and is indeed a very great Bleſſing; and that not only becauſe the longer Men live and the more vigorous they are, the longer and more fully they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, or at leaſt <hi>hope</hi> to enjoy the good things of this World (which yet with too many is the main Conſideration) but likewiſe and <hi>chiefly</hi> becauſe they have more Time and greater Opportunities to provide for the Happineſs of the eternal Life to come, and heap up ſtill greater Treaſures of Glory in the Kingdom of Heaven. Now this great Bleſſing nothing is more likely to help a Man to than Religion. For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, it engages Men to live regularly and temperately, moderates the Appetites of eating and drinking, and curbs the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Deſires of the fleſh; and by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more than is neceſſary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Support of Nature, makes no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for thoſe many deſtructive <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> which are always the Attendants of <hi>Exceſs.</hi> How many of the meaner Sort by <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>courſe</hi> Fare protract their Days, than of the Rich who live in Eaſe and Luxury? And the Reaſon is plain, becauſe the poor Man's ſcanty Fortune will not allow him to <hi>exceed,</hi> but keeps him within the Bounds of Moderation and Temperance, and forces him to be content with a <hi>little;</hi> whereas the rich have many and great Temptations to Luxury and Exceſs, and ſeldom are ſo religious as to <hi>reſiſt</hi> them, and ſo too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103289:64"/>feel the ſad <hi>Effects</hi> of Intemperance and live out but half their Days. But now, <hi>Religion</hi> is a kind of <hi>voluntary Poverty,</hi> and helps Men to all the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of a mean Condition, though rich and out of Danger of the <hi>Sting</hi> of it; and by introducing <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> and <hi>Moderation</hi> into the Families of the wealthy, brings with it Health and long Life, which otherwiſe would ſeldom be found but in the Cottages of the Poor.</p>
            <p>Again, Religion is greatly conducive to a long and healthy Life, becauſe it regulates the <hi>Paſſions,</hi> keeps the Soul quiet and in a <hi>Calm;</hi> which has no little Influence upon the Health and Welfare of the Body. That the Paſſions of the Mind do very much affect the Body, is undeniable; and when they are <hi>exceſſive,</hi> nothing more ſhakes and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the whole Man. Even <hi>Joy,</hi> which one would think ſhould be innocent enough, has ſometimes been ſo violent as to overcharge Perſons and leave them dead, and <hi>Grief</hi> has been <hi>often</hi> fatal, and <hi>Envy</hi> is the worſt Sort of Conſumption, and leaves viſible Tokens of it upon the Countenance, and <hi>Love</hi> has had <hi>many</hi> Martyrs, and <hi>Anger</hi> is a great Impoveriſher of the Animal Spirits, and oftentimes makes a Man his own Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and engages in ſuch Scuffles and hot Inconſiderate Actions, as not ſeldom end in <hi>Wounds</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi> Every Exceſs of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of what kind ſoever, is naturally a great <hi>Impairer</hi> of Health at leaſt, and the often Repetitions of it, the ready Way to <hi>deſtroy</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:103289:65"/>it; Nature not being able to bear ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Concuſſions long, without being much weaken'd and <hi>ſhatter'd</hi> by them: Like the Walls of a Caſtle, which, how ſtrong ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, will receive Damage by every furious Battery, and unleſs reliev'd, muſt at length fall before the Cannons Irreſiſtible Force.</p>
            <p>But now, Religion prevents all this Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief; and by regulating and reducing to <hi>Moderation</hi> theſe Paſſions of the Soul, makes the Mind calm and quiet, and keeps the Spirits in an <hi>Aequipoiſe;</hi> and the Body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently is undiſturb'd, feels no Violence, nor is hurried on to dangerous and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Actions; but Nature goes on <hi>evenly</hi> in making Proviſion for its Health and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and it enjoys its Strength and Beauty as in the Times of Quietneſs and Peace.</p>
            <p>In the laſt Place, a comfortable Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of a much <hi>better</hi> and <hi>endleſs</hi> Life in the Regions of Glory, can ſpring from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſincere Religion; and therefore Religion is of very great Value with Reſpect to <hi>this</hi> world. For what can be of greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and more to be deſired in this Valley of Tears, this World of Sin, and Sorrow, and Ignorance, Vexation, and Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than to have a well grounded Hope that 'twill not be <hi>always</hi> ſo with us? That there will be a Time when all Tears ſhall be wip'd from our Eyes, and Sin and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be at an End for ever? That we ſhall one Day be diſentangled from the Clog of Fleſh, the Priſon Doors ſet open, and our
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103289:65"/>captiv'd Souls ſet free, and with Joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and full of Glory, return to the great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits, and with the full Vigour of all their Faculties contemplate and enjoy the only ſatisfying Good? That inſtead of Floods of <hi>Years,</hi> there ſhall then be Rivers of <hi>Pleaſures</hi> flowing in upon us to all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Halleluia's inſtead of Groans and mournfull Accents; the triumphant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycings of eternal beatified Spirits inſtead of the bitter Complaints of miſerable Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; and in a word, <hi>Love</hi> in its Perfection inſtead of Quarrels and Diſcontents, Envy, and Hatred, and Malice, and Revenge, and all the dire Attendants of them? That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſpiritual <hi>Blindneſs</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the moſt <hi>concerning</hi> Truths (for here we know but in Part, and ſee through a Glaſs darkly) we ſhall e're long, be admitted to contemplate <hi>Truth it ſelf,</hi> and <hi>know as we are known,</hi> and ſhall ſee <hi>God as he is,</hi> and in him all things? For <hi>God is Light.</hi> What can be more valuable than ſuch a chearing Expectation as this! How will it ſweeten all the Troubles of this Mortal Life and be a ſenſible Foretaſte of the Glory that ſhall hereafter be revealed!</p>
            <p>But now, nothing can create ſuch a Hope as this but <hi>ſincere Religion;</hi> for God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>pure and holy,</hi> and into his Preſence no <hi>unclean</hi> thing can enter. And 'tis expreſly ſaid in the Revelations of his Will, <hi>That without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> A <hi>wicked</hi> Mans Breaſt that is not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103289:66"/>
               <hi>ſeared,</hi> can be full of nothing but the dire Reflections of an enrag'd Conſcience, and dreadful forebodings of the Wrath to come. The Miſeries he feels in <hi>this</hi> World are but as the Beginnings of his <hi>eternal</hi> Sorrows; and while he <hi>continues</hi> in his Rebellion againſt God, he can expect nothing but new Expreſſes of his Indignation <hi>here,</hi> and to be doom'd to the Portion of the Devil and his Angels at the Day of Judgment. He only that has liv'd piouſly in this World can with any Comfort think upon a future State: But to him that has led this <hi>Firſt</hi> Life by the Rule of Religion, and ſerv'd his Mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Sincerity of Heart, no Joy compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that which he experiences when he thinks of being diſſolv'd, and conducted to the Embraces of his Saviour, in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, where he ſhall be for ever with him, and unſpeakably happy in the Joy of his dear Lord.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the Value of Religion with Relation to <hi>this</hi> World. It is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the moſt perfect <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Quietneſs, Content</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Mind, of a <hi>long</hi> and <hi>healthy</hi> Life here, and of a comfortable Expectation of a glorious Immortality in the Regions of Bleſſedneſs. And were this all that could be ſaid of it, I queſtion not but to any conſidering Man, it would appear to be a <hi>Jewel of ineſtimable Price;</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the whole World can afford is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to it; and that he is the wiſeſt Man, who, with the Merchant in the Parable,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103289:66"/>immediately parts with <hi>all</hi> that ſtands in Competition with <hi>Religion,</hi> and would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him in the Performance of the Duties of it.</p>
            <p>But this is far from <hi>all;</hi> Godlineſs has not only a Promiſe of the Life that <hi>now is,</hi> but alſo, and chiefly of that which is <hi>to come:</hi> And, if it appears to be ſo ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Treaſure when we look no further than this Life, what ſhall we think of it when we contemplate that exceeding Weight of Glory which ſhall be its Reward in Heaven!</p>
            <p>The Happineſs that will crown Religion in the other World, ſpringing from the ſame Fountain from whence do flow the Felicities of <hi>God himſelf; (i. e.)</hi> it conſiſting in an intimate View and full Enjoyment of the Beauties and Perfections of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (for ſo St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>We ſhall ſee God as he is.)</hi> It muſt needs be <hi>inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> Nay, the very <hi>Contemplation</hi> of it is too bright for Minds darkned with Fleſh, the Splendors of it flaſh too ſtrongly upon our feeble Senſe now we are in the Body, and too long and cloſely gaz'd on will rather <hi>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle</hi> than <hi>enlighten</hi> our Underſtandings. No <hi>Mortal</hi> Man can <hi>ſee God's Face and live;</hi> and therefore moſt true is that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9.</note> 
               <hi>neither can it enter into the Heart of Man to conceive the things that God hath reſerv'd for thoſe that love him.</hi> Indeed, this includes all that can poſſibly be imagin'd of Excellence, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103289:67"/>much more than we poor ignorant <hi>benighted</hi> Creatures can imagin.</p>
            <p>For God is the Fountain of Being, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of Perfection: All that is charming and truly deſirable in Nature, to our Senſes, or to our Underſtandings, in the viſible or inviſible Creation; is but a Stream from this divine Fountain, and is in <hi>him</hi> ininfinitely greater Excellency. For, he is Beauty, and Goodneſs, and Harmony <hi>it ſelf.</hi> And therefore, ſince Religion will bring us to ſuch a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as the Viſion and Enjoyment of this <hi>chief Good;</hi> what can compare with it for <hi>Value? The Depth ſays, 'tis not in me, and the Sea ſays, 'tis not with me; Man knoweth not the Price there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, neither is it found in the Land of the Living. It cannot be valued with the Gold of</hi> Ophir, <hi>with the precious</hi> Onyx <hi>or the</hi> Saphire; <hi>no mention ſhall be made of Coral or Pearls, for the Price of Wiſdom is above Rubies,</hi> Job 28.13. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Such then being the Excellency of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that it is above all things conducive to the Happineſs of Man in <hi>this</hi> World, and will bring him to the Enjoyment of <hi>God himſelf</hi> to eternal Ages, when this ſhort Life is ended; and the whole that the <hi>World</hi> can afford, amounting to no more, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of one that enjoy'd it all to the Full, than <hi>Emptineſs</hi> and <hi>Diſappointment, Vanity and Vexation of Spirit</hi> here; and if the Word of God be true, an eternal <hi>Baniſhment</hi> from the <hi>ſupreme Good</hi> ſhall at laſt be their Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who love this worthleſs World, more than Religion and their Maker: Theſe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103289:67"/>things being duly weighed and conſidered, let any Man in his Wits ſay, which is of greateſt Value, <hi>Religion</hi> or the <hi>World?</hi> And which is the wiſeſt Man, he that ruins his Soul for the Gain of even the whole World, or he that counts all theſe ſublunary things as <hi>Dung</hi> in Compariſon with <hi>Religion,</hi> and is ready to part with <hi>all</hi> that this Earth can afford him for the Joys of a good Conſcience here, and the Glories of Heaven hereafter? He that prefers the <hi>World</hi> in his Choice, deprives himſelf of the greateſt Comfort of this <hi>preſent</hi> Life, and parts with the certain Reverſion of eternal Happineſs in <hi>Heaven,</hi> for Pleaſures that don't deſerve that Name, they are ſo <hi>empty</hi> and <hi>unſatisfying;</hi> he brings moſt exquiſite and everlaſting Miſery upon his <hi>whole</hi> ſelf Soul and Body, for a very ſhort liv'd imperfect Gratification of his <hi>brutal</hi> Part only, and purchaſes the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the other World by making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>unhappy in this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a Word therefore, as much as to be like <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> is to be preferr'd before being like the <hi>Devil</hi> in <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Miſery;</hi> as much as <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is better than <hi>Diſappointment, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Quietneſs,</hi> and <hi>Content,</hi> than <hi>Vexation</hi> and continual <hi>Diſturbance</hi> and <hi>Perplexity</hi> of Mind, a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd</hi> Health and long Life, than the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes</hi> and <hi>haſty</hi> Death that follows Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the comfortable Expectation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ever happy with Saints and Angels, and the bleſſed God in the Coeleſtial Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103289:68"/>than the confounding Dread of the Judgment of the great Day: As much as Immortality is more to be prized than a Life of a Span long, and the Enjoyment of the <hi>chief Good,</hi> than the Pleaſures of a <hi>Swine;</hi> of ſo much gerater Value is Religion than all that this World can afford, and indeed the only deſirable <hi>Treaſure,</hi> and a <hi>Pearl</hi> of <hi>ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable Price.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, if what has been hitherto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcours'd be true, the Application is eaſy. If Religion be of all things the moſt precious, let us make it more and more our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>inrich</hi> our Souls with this <hi>Treaſure,</hi> to <hi>adorn</hi> our rational Nature with this <hi>Pearl of great Price;</hi> and with the Merchant in the Parable, think nothing too much to part with, that we may purchaſe that Heavenly Wiſdom which will make us wiſe to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For, <hi>ſound Wiſdom,</hi> as the wiſe King expreſſes it,
<note place="margin">Prov. 3.18.</note> 
               <hi>is a Tree of Life to thoſe that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth her. She ſhall give to thine Head an Oranment of Grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 4.9.</note> 
               <hi>and a Crown of Glory ſhall ſhe deliver to thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, he that would have this Wiſdom, and find this Pearl, muſt not only <hi>wiſh</hi> and <hi>deſire,</hi> but, with the Merchant in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, diligently <hi>ſeek</hi> it; <hi>ſeek and ye ſhall find,</hi> ſays our Lord;
<note place="margin">Pro. 2.4, 5.</note> and <hi>Solomon</hi> aſſures us, <hi>That if we ſeek Wiſdom as Silver, and ſearch for her as for hid Treaſure, then ſhall we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Fear of the Lord, and find the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:103289:68"/>
            <p>Religion is not acquired without <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;</hi> for though it be the Gift of God, yet the Soul muſt be prepared to receive it; all evil Habits muſt be broke and rooted up, and pious Diſpoſitions planted in their Room, and the Temper of the Mind chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Repentance, and all the Powers of the whole Man become pliable to the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit of Holineſs before the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Likeneſs can be formed in the Soul. And though 'tis the Grace of God that ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles us to go thus far (for without it we can do <hi>nothing</hi>) yet our own Concurrence and <hi>Co-operation</hi> with his Grace is neceſſary to bring the bleſſed Work of Regeneration to <hi>Perfection.</hi> An obſtinate <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Grace will grieve and <hi>quench</hi> that Life-giving Spirit; and ſuch a Soul ſhall know no more of Religion, than that it was invited to it, but rejected the Offer, and <hi>might</hi> have been happy in the Enjoyment of ſo great a Treaſure, but it <hi>would</hi> not. But, when a Soul with <hi>Joy</hi> embraces the Motions of the holy Spirit to a new Life, and makes it her great Endeavour to remove all Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles out of the Way, that they may make a due <hi>Impreſſion,</hi> and hungers and thirſts after <hi>new</hi> Degrees of Righteouſneſs; This Soul ſhall be <hi>fill'd</hi> with the Treaſures of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, and the Power of Godlineſs will be viſible in all Manner of holy Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. But this can't be perform'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>watchful perſevering Diligence;</hi> there is ſo much Oppoſition from within and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103289:69"/>without to this great Buſineſs, that like <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi>'s Labourers,
<note place="margin">Neh. 5.17.</note> we muſt work with our <hi>Swords in our Hands,</hi> and fight and ſtrive, that we may carry on the Building of a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Temple for our God, and make our Souls Houſes of Prayer, adorn'd with reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Affections, and ſit to receive him that hates Iniquity.

            <p>Let us all therefore be <hi>ſtedfaſt unmoveable, and always abound in this Work of the Lord, for as much as we know our Labour ſhall not be in vain;</hi> and to our diligent Purſuit of this ineſtimable Treaſure of Religion, let us add frequent and earneſt Prayer to God, who is the only Giver of every good and perfect Gift, that he would ſend down Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from his holy Heaven, that being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſhe may labour with us, that we may know what is pleaſing in his Sight, and ſet our ſelves to do it with all Alacrity, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with Diligence and Patience the <hi>Race that is ſet before us, looking unto Jeſus the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Finiſher of our Faith; who for the Joy that was ſet before him, endur'd the Croſs, deſpiſing the Shame,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Happy is the Exchange of <hi>all</hi> that this World can afford for a Jewel of ſo great Price as <hi>Religion,</hi> and for ſuch inexhauſtible Treaſures of Bliſs as are reſerved to <hi>Reward</hi> it in the Preſence of God.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103289:70"/>my Love from that which does not, cannot ſatisfy, and is indeed but Vanity and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit, and fix it upon that which is above all things valuable: That ſo, I may be convinc'd by a happpy Experience, that true Pleaſure, and Freedom, and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is only to be met with in thy Service; and that I am ſo little deſign'd for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the World and of Senſe, that the longer I live to prove them, the leſs capable I ſhall be of their Enjoyment. O may that Peace and Tranquillity within my own Breaſt, that Quiet with others, that Health and Length of Days which is in the Right Hand of Religion, and the durable Riches and true Honour that is in her Left, and that chearing Expectation of Heaven when this frail Tabernacle ſhall be diſſolv'd; may this which is the natural Offſpring of true Piety leave ſo lovely an Idea of it upon my Soul, that I may value it as indeed the greateſt Treaſure, and a Pearl of ineſtimable Price!

                  <p>Then the Lord of that Servant was moved with Compaſſion, and looſed him, and forgave him the Debt.</p>
                  <p>But the ſame Servant went out, and found
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103289:71"/>one of his Fellow-Servants which ought him an Hundred Pence: And he laid hands on him and took him by the Throat, ſaying, pay me that thou oweſt.</p>
                  <p>And his Fellow-Servant fell down at his Feet, ſaying, have Patience with me and I will pay thee all.</p>
                  <p>And he would not; but went and caſt him into Priſon, till he ſhould pay the Debt.</p>
                  <p>So when his Fellow-Servants ſaw what was done, they were very ſorry, and came and told unto their Lord all that was done.</p>
                  <p>Then his Lord, after that he had called him, ſaid unto him, O thou wicked Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, I forgave thee all that Debt becauſe thou deſiredſt me:</p>
                  <p>Shouldſt not thou alſo have Compaſſion of thy Fellow-Servant, even as I had Pity on thee?</p>
                  <p>And his Lord was wroth, and delivered him to the Tormentors, till he ſhould pay all that was due unto him.</p>
                  <p>So alſo ſhall my heavenly Father do alſo unto you, if ye from your Hearts forgive not everyone his Brother their Treſpaſſes.</p>

In which Parable, there are two things in <hi>general</hi> to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The mercifull <hi>Example</hi> of God's Dealing with us miſerable Sinners, who lay under a vaſt Debt to his Juſtice; expreſs'd by a King's taking Account of his Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and forgiving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, His great <hi>Diſpleaſure</hi> againſt thoſe that will not <hi>imitate</hi> that his compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Example, in <hi>forgiving</hi> ſuch as have been <hi>injurious</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> expreſs'd by the King's being wroth with his unmerciful Servant, who, though he receiv'd ſo much Kindneſs himſelf, would ſhew none to his Fellow-Servant who owed him a Trifle in Compariſon; but, without the leaſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, threw him into Priſon till he ſhould pay it; upon which his Lord <hi>delivered him over to the Tormentors, till he ſhould pay all that was due unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under The <hi>firſt</hi> General, there are three <hi>Particulars</hi> to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Greatneſs of the Debt which by Sin we have contracted to the Divine Juſtice, expreſſed by <hi>Ten Thouſand Talents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Impoſſibility of <hi>our</hi> ever <hi>clearing</hi> this Debt, and the ſad Conſequence if it ſtill ſhould have remain'd upon Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; expreſs'd here by the King's Debtor
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103289:72"/>
               <hi>having nothing to pay,</hi> and the King's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding that therefore <hi>he ſhould be ſold, and his Wife, and Children, and all that he had,</hi> that ſo Payment might be made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The wondrous <hi>Compaſſion</hi> of our good God, in <hi>pitying</hi> our miſerable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>forgiving</hi> us all our Debt; expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by that King's being mov'd with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion at the deplorable Condition of his inſolvent Servant, and <hi>looſing him and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving him the Debt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under the <hi>ſecond</hi> General there are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe three <hi>Particulars</hi> to be conſider'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What it is to forgive one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven us, and the great Obligation we have to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate this Example of our merciful God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our great <hi>Baſeneſs</hi> if we do not; and</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The miſerable <hi>Conſequence</hi> that will attend that Baſeneſs, we ſhall provoke God to <hi>recall</hi> his Pardon to <hi>us,</hi> and <hi>be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd over to the Tormentors till we ſhall pay all that is due unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>General</hi> to be conſider'd in this Parable, is God's <hi>Example</hi> in dealing with us miſerable Sinners, who lay under a <hi>vaſt Debt</hi> to his <hi>Juſtice;</hi> expreſs'd by a <hi>King's taking Account of his Servants,</hi> and freely <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving one that was deeply indebted to him.</hi> And the firſt <hi>Particular</hi> to be conſider'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, is, the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of the <hi>Debt,</hi> which by <hi>Sin</hi> we have contracted to the Divine <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="126" facs="tcp:103289:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>By contracting a Debt to the Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is meant the having <hi>violated</hi> the juſt and holy <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and thereby becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>obnoxious</hi> to his <hi>juſt Anger,</hi> unleſs we ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his Juſtice ſome other Way. As a <hi>convict</hi> Criminal, we ſay, has not <hi>ſatisfyed,</hi> or is <hi>indebted</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> till he has ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> for his Crime which the Law thinks fit to <hi>inflict;</hi> or elſe finds Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and has it <hi>remitted</hi> him.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of the Debt which Mankind by his Sin has thus contracted to the divine Juſtice, 'tis expreſs'd in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by <hi>ten thouſand Talents;</hi> which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Way of Reckoning, is above a <hi>Million of Pounds.</hi> A vaſt Sum this, but yet far ſhort of what we owe to the Juſtice of God by Reaſon of our Iniquities; which are, not only <hi>Millions,</hi> but <hi>Innumerable,</hi> even <hi>as the Stars in Heaven,</hi> and <hi>the Sand upon the Sea-Shore:</hi> Nor are they only <hi>numberleſs,</hi> but very <hi>great;</hi> not only many <hi>Thouſands,</hi> but many Thouſands of <hi>Talents.</hi> Every <hi>Sin,</hi> as 'tis a wilfull Violation of the Laws of God, has Weight enough <hi>(if God ſhould be extreme to mark what is done amiſs)</hi> to ſink a Soul into eternal Ruin: And the Reaſon is becauſe <hi>God</hi>'s is the <hi>higheſt Authority,</hi> and his <hi>Laws</hi> moſt <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>equal,</hi> and we have an <hi>infinite</hi> Obligation to <hi>obey</hi> him, both as his <hi>Creatures</hi> and <hi>Dependents,</hi> who <hi>live</hi> by his <hi>Favour</hi> and Bounty, and have received numberleſs and ineſtimable Bleſſings from him; and likewiſe as <hi>rational</hi> Creatures,

               <hi>Second</hi> Place, That 'twas utterly impoſſible for them of <hi>themſelves</hi> ever to <hi>clear</hi> this Debt, and make Satisfaction to the divine Juſtice; and the ſad Conſequence, ſhould it have ſtill remain'd upon <hi>Account,</hi> would have been no leſs than <hi>eternal Miſery.</hi> Which is repreſented very <hi>lively</hi> in the Parable, by the King's Debtor having <hi>nothing to pay,</hi> and the King thereupon commanding <hi>that he ſhould be ſold, and his Wife, and Children, and all that he had, and Payment made.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſo uſing Debtors that were not able to pay.

            </p>
            <p>'Tis utterly impoſſible for Mankind of <hi>themſelves</hi> ever to have paid this vaſt Debt, becauſe <hi>every</hi> individual meer Man is deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged and always will be ſo in the ſame Account; ſo <hi>deeply,</hi> that he can never clear <hi>himſelf,</hi> much leſs make Satisfaction for <hi>others:</hi> Nor is there any thing valuable enough in all the Treaſures of Nature to buy off this Sentence, <hi>juſt,</hi> though <hi>ſad, The Soul that ſinneth it ſhall die. Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mic. 6.6.</note> ſays the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> when he had a Controverſy with the People for their Sins, <hi>and wherewith ſhall I bow my ſelf before the high God? Shall I come before him with Burnt Offerings, with Calves of a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103289:74"/>Year old; will the Lord be pleaſed with Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Rams or Ten Thouſands of Rivers of Oil? Shall I give my Firſt-born for my Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, the Fruit of my Body for the Sin of my Soul?</hi> As if he had ſaid, what's all this to him that is the Creator of every thing, the Lord and great Proprietor of all already; and whoſe Glory and Happineſs is infinitely above even <hi>our</hi> moſt exalted Thoughts and Conceptions? He is an Ideot that does not confeſs that all the Riches of the Univerſe are utterly inſufficient, as the Pſalmiſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, to <hi>redeem the forfeited Souls of Mankind, ſo that that muſt be let alone for ever:</hi> All therefore that is in Man to give being, far from ſufficient to commute for the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment his Sins has deſerv'd; God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice muſt be ſatisfyed by his <hi>undergoing</hi> that Puniſhment; that is, eternal Death; for ever <hi>dying</hi> yet never <hi>dead, extremely</hi> miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and <hi>for ever</hi> ſo. A Puniſhment ſo inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly great, that <hi>Annihilation</hi> is much to be preferr'd before it; for who can dwell with <hi>everlaſting Burnings!</hi> Who can bear an <hi>eternal Baniſhment</hi> from the <hi>ſupreme Good,</hi> and Confinement to the dire Abodes of the Devil and his Angels, thoſe mercileſs Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners of the divine Juſtice, who will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the Pains we are to ſuffer with the utmoſt Cruelty! Who can bear the <hi>Gnawings</hi> of that never dying Worm, Remorſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, for <hi>forfeiting</hi> ſuch infinite <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and plunging our ſelves headlong in ſuch a <hi>bottomleſs Miſery,</hi> and that for the Sake of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103289:75"/>what was always <hi>empty</hi> and <hi>unſatisfying,</hi> even when we did <hi>enjoy it!</hi> And who can bear the Horrors of <hi>Deſpair</hi> of ever ſeeing an <hi>End</hi> of ſuch Torments as theſe, which yet might have been intirely avoided if we would! <hi>This</hi> is <hi>indeed</hi> an unconceivably <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable</hi> Condition, and all Men that ever liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed muſt have been involv'd in it, had not the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of <hi>God</hi> found out a Means both to ſatisfie his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and at the ſame Time to be <hi>merciful</hi> to his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Creatures: To <hi>forgive</hi> the Debt to thoſe that had nothing to pay, and yet to have full <hi>Satisfaction</hi> made him for it. 'Tis what could never have enter'd into the Heart of <hi>Man</hi> to <hi>conceive;</hi> 'tis the great <hi>Myſtery</hi> of divine <hi>Love,</hi> which even the Angels deſire to look into, and 'tis that which is and ſhall be the Subject of eternal Hallelujah's in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi> therefore, let us conſider the wondrous <hi>Compaſſion</hi> of our good God, in pitying our ſadly deplorable Condition, and <hi>forgiving</hi> us all that Debt which we could never have <hi>paid,</hi> though we had <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd</hi> the Pains of Hell, for <hi>thoſe</hi> ſhall never have an <hi>End;</hi> and this is expreſs'd in the Parable by the King's being mov'd with Compaſſion at the miſerable Condition of his <hi>inſolvent</hi> Servant, <hi>and looſing him and forgiving him the Debt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King in the Parable was very merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, who, upon the <hi>humble Entreaty</hi> of his poor Servant, and his Promiſe if he would
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103289:75"/>have Patience with him at length to <hi>pay him all,</hi> was moved to Compaſſion and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave him: But <hi>God</hi> is infinitely <hi>more</hi> merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in compaſſionating <hi>our</hi> Condition, and forgiving <hi>our</hi> great Debt, as will appear from the following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>For Firſt, <hi>our</hi> Debt is infinitely greater. Ten Thouſand Talents, in Compariſon of the <hi>numberleſs</hi> Number of the heinous Sins of Mankind, are but as the Sand of an <hi>Hour-Glaſs,</hi> compar'd with that of the <hi>Sea-Shore;</hi> and <hi>one wilful</hi> Violation of <hi>our</hi> Obedience to <hi>God,</hi> is a <hi>far weightier</hi> Debt to the divine <hi>Juſtice,</hi> than Millions of Talents would be from one <hi>Mortal</hi> to <hi>another.</hi> And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is plain, becauſe the <hi>Diſtance</hi> between God and Man is <hi>infinite;</hi> and for a <hi>Beggar</hi> to ſpurn at a <hi>Prince,</hi> is certainly a Crime of much higher Aggravation, than to do the like to one of his own ragged Gang.</p>
            <p>All that is culpable (as was ſaid) is met together in a <hi>wilful Sin;</hi> and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and amazingly great muſt be the Guilt of all <hi>Man-kind,</hi> who have heap'd up Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions without Number; and have <hi>no Way</hi> left of <hi>paying</hi> this great Debt, but by ſuffering without End the <hi>Pains of Hell.</hi> And ſuch a dreadful Puniſhment as this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing annex'd to Sin by him who is infinitely <hi>good</hi> and <hi>juſt;</hi> is Argument ſufficient, that there is no Debt comparable to that which a guilty <hi>Sinner</hi> owes to the Juſtice of God. And therefore, when God gives <hi>Mercy,</hi> ſo <hi>great</hi> an Exaltation as to forgive ſo <hi>vaſt</hi> a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103289:76"/>Debt as <hi>this;</hi> 'tis Compaſſion impoſſible to be parallel'd.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God's Compaſſion in forgiving <hi>us</hi> is infinitely greater than that good King's in the Parable, becauſe we leſs <hi>deſerve God</hi>'s Favour than that poor Servant did his <hi>Lord's. He acknowledg'd</hi> his Debt, and was <hi>griev'd</hi> for his not being able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it and humbly <hi>ſubmitted</hi> himſelf to his offended Lord; but 'tis quite otherwiſe with <hi>us, we</hi> add <hi>Obſtinacy</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> to our long Score, are ſtill in actual Rebellion againſt God, and daily more and more provoke him by <hi>new</hi> Impieties: <hi>We</hi> make what Haſte we can, as the Prophet expreſſes it, to <hi>fill up</hi> the Meaſure of our <hi>Fathers</hi> Iniquities and our <hi>own,</hi> rather than by <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Life to <hi>leſſen</hi> the great Account that is againſt us.</p>
            <p>And this is to enflame God's <hi>Anger</hi> rather than to move his <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> and does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deſerve <hi>quick Vengeance</hi> rather than <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs.</hi> And yet, ſo boundleſs an Ocean is the <hi>divine Goodneſs,</hi> even in this <hi>rebellious</hi> State <hi>God</hi> pities his poor unhappy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>and is full of Compaſſion, long-ſuffering, and of great Kindneſs, and repenteth him of the Evil;</hi> and when we deſerve nothing but the <hi>ſevereſt</hi> Puniſhment, thinketh upon <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſs;</hi> and propoſes very eaſie Conditions of Reconciliation and Readmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to his Favour, and even <hi>courts</hi> us to accept them: <hi>Turn ye, turn ye from your evil Ways, for why will ye dye O Houſe of Iſrael!</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:103289:76"/>
            <p>Now for the great and infinitely <hi>happy God,</hi> to treat ſuch <hi>hardned Rebels</hi> at ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and compaſſionate a rate; to be ſo ready to forgive thoſe who not at all <hi>deſerve</hi> it, but rather the utmoſt Expreſſes of his <hi>Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</hi> is doubtleſs a Mercy <hi>infinite</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Compariſon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The poor Debtor in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>humbly beſought</hi> his Lord's Pity and Forbearance, he fell down on his Face and worſhipped him, and by that his <hi>humble Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour</hi> and <hi>earneſt Intreaty,</hi> inclin'd his Lord to commiſerate his ſad Condition. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this, <hi>we</hi> are not ſo <hi>little</hi> ſenſible of, or afflicted with <hi>any</hi> thing, as that great Debt we owe to the divine Juſtice. So <hi>far</hi> from paſſionately <hi>begging</hi> for our Pardon, that we ſpend but very few <hi>Thoughts</hi> about it, and <hi>moſt</hi> of us are very <hi>little,</hi> and ſome not <hi>at all apprehenſive</hi> of the Need we have of being again receiv'd into God's Favour, and the ſad Conſequence if we are <hi>not:</hi> And are far more ſollicitous about <hi>promoting</hi> ſome <hi>petty</hi> Intereſt in <hi>this</hi> World, than about the <hi>Pardon of our Sins,</hi> which is the One Thing neceſſary in Order to our Eſcape from <hi>Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is ſo great a <hi>ſlighting</hi> and <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing</hi> God's Forgiveneſs, expreſſes ſo much <hi>Indifferency</hi> whether he does it or no; that one would think it ſhould be enough to provoke God to <hi>reſolve</hi> the <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> and ſwear in his Wrath that they ſhall never enter into his Reſt.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:103289:77"/>
            <p>And yet, ſo wondrouſly compaſſionate is our good God, <hi>unſought</hi> to, <hi>undeſired,</hi> he of his own meer <hi>Tenderneſs,</hi> intirely forgave the <hi>paſt</hi> Offences of his thoughtleſs Creatures, and for the <hi>Future</hi> ſtill promis'd Forgiveneſs to ſuch as ſhould offend anew, upon this only <hi>eaſie</hi> Condition, that they ſhould no more <hi>wilfully</hi> break his holy Laws, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <hi>repent</hi> when through <hi>Surprize</hi> or <hi>Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency</hi> or the Force of <hi>Temptation</hi> they ſhould do amiſs. And to be thus merciful notwithſtanding ſo much Provocation to the contrary, is Compaſſion that has no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God's Goodneſs in pitying and forgiving <hi>Sinners,</hi> is infinitely greater than that of the King in the Parable in forgiving his poor Debtor; becauſe the <hi>Miſery Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi> is delivered from by this Mercy of <hi>God,</hi> is infinitely <hi>greater,</hi> than <hi>that</hi> which the poor <hi>Wretch</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel eſcap'd</hi> by the Compaſſion of <hi>his Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His</hi> Puniſhment, had his Lord dealt <hi>rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly</hi> with him, would have been, that he ſhould be ſold, and his Wife, and Children, and all that he had, that ſo, in ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at leaſt Payment might be made; and the <hi>utmoſt</hi> that this could amount to was <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> both of <hi>himſelf</hi> and all his <hi>Family,</hi> all the Days of his Life: Which though indeed a very <hi>ſad</hi> Condition, and ſuch as no Submiſſion could be too great, no Entreaties too earneſt to <hi>avoid;</hi> yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, comes infinitely ſhort of theſe <hi>eternal</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:103289:77"/>Miſeries in the Regions of Darkneſs, and in the Society of the Devil and his Angels, which would have been the Portion of the <hi>whole Race of Mankind,</hi> had not God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Forgiveneſs prevented it, and given us better Hopes.</p>
            <p>Now the greater the <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the <hi>Charity</hi> that <hi>relieves</hi> it; the greater and more <hi>general</hi> the <hi>Danger,</hi> the more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable the <hi>Reſcue;</hi> the more extreme the Miſery, and the greater the Number of thoſe that were condemn'd to ſuffer it, the greater the Compaſſion that relents and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers from it. It being therefore abſolutely <hi>neceſſary</hi> that God ſhould <hi>pardon</hi> Sinners, that they might eſcape the Puniſhment due to Sin (for they had nothing to pay) and the Danger of thoſe Puniſhments being <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent,</hi> the Meaſure of Men's Iniquities riſing to ſo <hi>great a Height;</hi> and the Miſery that would have involv'd all Man-kind, had God's Vengeance had its free Courſe, and Sin its due Reward, being no leſs than that of <hi>Hell,</hi> and that for <hi>ever</hi> too: That Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of God that inclin'd him to forgive ſo <hi>many</hi> wretched Debtors as the <hi>whole Race of Man-kind,</hi> and prevented ſuch otherwiſe <hi>unavoidable, endleſs</hi> and <hi>unconceivable Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> was certainly <hi>infinite Compaſſion,</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully great and beyond Compariſon.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The <hi>Conſequence</hi> of God's forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners is infinitely <hi>happier</hi> than that of the Forgiveneſs of the poor Debtor in the Parable.</p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:103289:78"/>
            <p>
               <hi>He,</hi> after his Lord's looſing and forgiving him, was out of Fear indeed of that ſad Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune which otherwiſe muſt have faln up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; he enjoy'd his Liberty, and that of his Wife and Children, and continu'd ſtill in Poſſeſſion of what he had, 'till he forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all again by his Cruelty to his Fellow-Servant, which was no mean Comfort; but then this was all: We read of no <hi>new</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours conferr'd upon him, or that he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with any more of his Lord's Revenue, or the like.</p>
            <p>But now, the compaſſionate <hi>God,</hi> has to <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> of Sinners, added innumerable and ineſtimable <hi>Faziours;</hi> dignifi'd them with the Title of his <hi>Sons,</hi> communicated to them freſh Aſſiſtances of his bleſſed Spirit to help and guide them in the Way to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and promiſed them Crowns of eternal Glory, and everlaſting Inheritances in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and an intimate Viſion and Enjoyment of <hi>himſelf</hi> (who is the Center of Felicity) provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they continue ſincerely obedient to him for the Time to come. There is no Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which a rational Creature is <hi>capable</hi> of, but God, in his infinite Mercy freely and bountifully confers upon Man-kind, now that his Compaſſions have reconciled them to him;
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.17.</note> and in the Words of St. <hi>Paul, He gives us richly all things to enjoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for God, not only to <hi>forgive</hi> obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Rebels againſt his divine Government, to paſs by their vile <hi>Ingratitude</hi> to <hi>him</hi> their greateſt Benefactor, and baſe Abuſe of his
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103289:78"/>Bleſſings to his Diſhonour; but to confer upon 'em <hi>Favours</hi> of the greateſt Value, to receive 'em into his own <hi>Boſom,</hi> and make 'em Coheirs with his eternal Son, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance 'em to his heavenly Kingdom: This is ſuch an admirable Expreſſion of the divine Goodneſs and Love of Mankind, as could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proceed from any other but him who is <hi>Goodneſs it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the laſt Place, that which exalts the Compaſſion of God to the higheſt Degree, and makes it indeed <hi>miraculous,</hi> is the amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Courſe he took thus to ſhew <hi>Mercy</hi> in the <hi>Pardon</hi> of Sinners, and yet <hi>ſatisfie his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> too.</p>
            <p>The King in the Parable was at Liberty to diſpoſe of his <hi>own</hi> as he pleaſed, and he might have forgiven, without further Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to any thing of <hi>Juſtice</hi> in that Caſe, a <hi>greater</hi> Debt if it had been owing to him: But in the Caſe of God's forgiving <hi>Sinners</hi> it was otherwiſe. God had before ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declar'd to our firſt Parents, and very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten afterwards, that <hi>the Soul that ſinned it ſhould die;</hi> and his Juſtice was concern'd to ſee that Sentence executed; and in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing likewiſe 'twas perfectly <hi>juſt</hi> that the Violaters of God's holy and good Commands, ungrateful Rebels againſt their <hi>Creator</hi> and greateſt <hi>Benefactor,</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a due Recompence for their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Juſtice</hi> is as eſſential to <hi>God</hi> as <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> and though his infinite <hi>Goodneſs</hi> mov'd
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103289:79"/>him to have <hi>Compaſſion</hi> upon Sinners, yet his <hi>Juſtice</hi> pleaded for their <hi>Puniſhment;</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy would <hi>remit</hi> the Debt, but <hi>Juſtice</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> A Difficulty this, which <hi>mortal</hi> Wit could never ſolve. But God, who is infinitely <hi>wiſe</hi> as well as <hi>good</hi> and juſt, that the Work of his Hands might not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, nor his Image and Likeneſs be for ever miſerable, and that his <hi>Juſtice</hi> likewiſe might be fully <hi>ſatisfyed;</hi> contriv'd a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous Way for the Redemption of Sinners, by freely forgiving 'em their vaſt Debt, and yet making full Satisfaction to his <hi>Juſtice</hi> for the Sins of the whole World. And that was, by the Incarnation of his bleſſed Son, and ſubſtituting him in our ſtead, to ſuffer, as the Repreſentative of Mankind, the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to their Iniquities, and by his ſpotleſs Blood to make an univerſal Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and through the Merit of that his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sacrifice</hi> (for what's above the Merit of the Blood of the Son of God?) To pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe for them <hi>Pardon</hi> and Forgiveneſs, the Love and Favour of God in this World, and the eternal Enjoyment of him in the next. And by this means, as the Apoſtle expreſſes it,
<note place="margin">Rom. 3.26.</note> 
               <hi>to declare his Righteouſnes, that he might be juſt; and the Juſtifyer</hi> likewiſe <hi>of him that beleiveth in Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> are miraculouſly met together, and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> have kiſs'd each other. And for ever bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be that infinitely <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>juſt Compaſſion,</hi> which in ſo wondrous a Manner contriv'd
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103289:79"/>the <hi>Forgiveneſs of our vaſt Debt,</hi> and the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> of the divine <hi>Juſtice</hi> too! What Love can be greater than this, that God ſhould ſend his eternal Son into the World to be the Propitiation for Sinners! And that while we were <hi>Enemies,</hi> Chriſt ſhould dye for us, and bear our Sins in his own Body on the Tree, that through his Stripes we might be healed! <hi>Wonderful art thou, O Lord, in thy Doings towards the Children of Men, and thy Mercy is over all thy Works!</hi> And O that our Hearts might be warm'd with the ſame divine Flame, and <hi>we might love much, to whom ſo much hath been forgiven!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much for the firſt thing to be conſidered in this Parable; namely, the glorious Example of Forgiveneſs that God has ſet us, in his dealing thus mercifully with us miſerable Sinners who lay under a vaſt Debt to the divine Juſtice, and had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to pay; and how infinitely this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of God to Sinners exceeds the greateſt and moſt generous Expreſſion of Forgiveneſs, that can be ſhewn by one Man to another. 'Tis greater than the King's forgiving Ten Thouſand Talents to his poor Servant in the Parable, becauſe he entreated him and had nothing to pay.</p>
            <p>I proceed now, to the <hi>ſecond</hi> General to be conſider'd in this Parable, which is, God's great Diſpleaſure againſt thoſe that will not <hi>imitate</hi> this his compaſſionate Example, in forgiving ſuch as have been injurious to <hi>them;</hi> but like that wicked Servant to whom
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103289:80"/>the King had been ſo <hi>gracious,</hi> rigidly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring full Satisfaction for little <hi>Trifles</hi> and <hi>Punctilios.</hi> As he, no ſooner out of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his compaſſionate Lord, <hi>but took his Fellow-Servant by the Throat, who ow'd him an Hundred Pence,</hi> and though intreated to have Patience, as earneſtly as he had but juſt before intreated his offended Lord, yet without the leaſt Pity, threw him into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon till he ſhould pay the Debt. The <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> of ſuch a <hi>revengeful</hi> Temper will be like that of this cruel Servant, who was not only ſeverely <hi>rebuked</hi> for his Wickedneſs, but had the Pardon his Lord gave him <hi>recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> and <hi>was deliver'd over to the Tormentors till he ſhould pay the uttermoſt Farthing. So likewiſe ſhall my heavenly Father do unto you,</hi> ſays our Lord, <hi>if ye from your Hearts forgive not every one his Brother their Treſpaſſes.</hi> And under this General there are likewiſe, as was ſaid, Three Particulars to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>Firſt, What it is to forgive one another, <hi>as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven us;</hi> and the great <hi>Obligation</hi> we have to imitate this Example of our merciful God. To forgive one another in Imitation of the Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, is <hi>firſt</hi> to forgive ſuch as have injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, <hi>freely</hi> and without <hi>Reſerve;</hi> and that though they ſtill continue to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves our Enemies, and are ready to do us freſh Miſchiefs when it lies in their Power. For <hi>thus,</hi> as we have ſeen, <hi>God</hi> dealt with us miſerable <hi>Sinners; he firſt lov'd us,</hi> and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103289:80"/>while we were yet <hi>Sinners,</hi> and conſequently in open Hoſtility and Rebellion againſt him, even when he ſent his Son to dye for us, and be the Propitiation for our Sins: He took pity upon us when we were ſtill adding new Wickedneſſes to our long Account, and when we <hi>deſerved</hi> nothing but eternal <hi>Miſery,</hi> thought upon <hi>Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in Imitation of this, our Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to love our <hi>Enemies;</hi> not to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Evil</hi> for <hi>Evil,</hi> but contrariwiſe <hi>Bleſſing; that ſo we may be the Children of our Father which is in Heaven.</hi> For, to uſe our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Enforcement of this; if thoſe only ſhare in our Affections or Eſteem, who are as beneficial and kind to us as we to them, what Thank have we? Self-Love and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt may there be the Motives, and very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of True Piety and Goodneſs; nay, even the very worſt of Men may be as eminent for ſuch Sort of Charity as the beſt, Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Sinners, as our Lord obſerved, doing the ſame. But <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould be of a more <hi>Godlike</hi> Temper, their Charity more free and diſintereſſed; the greater and more frequent <hi>their</hi> Injuries, the more ready ſhould they be to pardon and <hi>forgive;</hi> and not only be reconciled after a <hi>ſeven-fold</hi> Wrong, but after one repeated <hi>ſeventy times ſeven.</hi> And our Saviour has likewiſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inforced this by his <hi>own</hi> Example, who with his laſt Breath pray'd for the Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his <hi>cruel Murtherers.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="142" facs="tcp:103289:81"/>
            <p>Secondly, We muſt not only forgive ſuch as but little <hi>deſerve</hi> it, but likewiſe, in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence to our <hi>divine Pattern,</hi> whether they <hi>deſire</hi> it or no: For thus it was in God's Forgiveneſs of Sinners, he <hi>prevented</hi> us by the Riches of his compaſſionate Goodneſs, and entreated us his rebellious Creatures, firſt by his Prophets, then by his only Son, to be reconcil'd to him, and embrace their Pardon. And thus, <hi>thoſe that will be Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of God as dear Children,</hi> muſt likewiſe do. Rather than Enmity ſhould continue we muſt <hi>ſeek</hi> to our Enemies to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd, though they were the firſt that <hi>offered</hi> the Offence. And this, however hardly it may ſound, is not only our Duty, by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that <hi>general</hi> Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d of forgiving one another <hi>as God has forgiven us,</hi> but is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly commanded by our compaſſionate Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. (which occaſion'd that Queſtion of St. <hi>Peter, Verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>How often ſhall I forgive my Brother?</hi> Upon which our Lord deliver'd this Parable) his Words are theſe, and deſerve our ſerious Attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Moreover, if thy Brother <hi>treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his Fault</hi> between thee and him alone. If thy Brother treſpaſs againſt thee,</hi> or as we uſually expreſs it, <hi>firſt</hi> did the Injury, or <hi>gave</hi> the Affront, <hi>go thou to him;</hi> ſtay not till <hi>he</hi> comes and <hi>acknowledges</hi> his Fault to <hi>thee,</hi> for that's a thing Men are very backward in doing, either for <hi>fear</hi> or for <hi>Shame,</hi> or out of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> as it muſt be term'd, or for other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;

                  </gap>
               </hi> for your good Will calmly tell him his Fault, expoſtulate the Caſe with him, and in all Likelyhood he <hi>will hear thee,</hi> a right Underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you will enſue, and thou ſhalt gain thy Brother. This is indeed to be like God in this great Excellence of forgiving Injuries, and is, as a moſt noble Expreſſion of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Charity, ſo we ſee very plainly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by our Lord, and ſhould be taken into our ſerious Conſideration in order to our agreeable <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, We muſt not only ſo far forgive as not to <hi>revenge,</hi> but in Imitation of the <hi>divine</hi> Pattern of Forgiveneſs ſet before us, be ready to do all Acts of <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence</hi> to our Enemy, as <hi>Occaſion</hi> ſhall ſerve, and his <hi>Needs</hi> require: Remembring the Words of our great Maſter, <hi>Do good to them that hate you, and pray for thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpightfully uſe you and perſecute you, for ſo ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103289:82"/>our ſelves to <hi>doubt</hi> the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs. For the <hi>ſmootheſt Words</hi> may be rotten and deceitful, and the not <hi>revenging</hi> an Injury may be for want of <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity;</hi> but when to good Words <hi>benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Actions</hi> are added, then may a Man well be thought to love and forgive, not in <hi>Word</hi> only, <hi>but in Deed and in Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Forgiveneſs of Injuries, or,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </note> in the Apoſtle's Words, <hi>the forgiving one another if any have a Quarrel againſt any, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven us:</hi> i.e. <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>intirely,</hi> though their Malice <hi>ſtill cotinues</hi> againſt us; nay, to <hi>go</hi> and <hi>offer</hi> 'em Forgiveneſs and Reconciliation tho' they neither <hi>deſire</hi> nor <hi>deſerve</hi> it, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company our Forgiveneſs with Acts of <hi>Kindneſs</hi> and <hi>good Turns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what has been ſaid upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count muſt have a <hi>Limitation;</hi> leſt it bound indiſcriminately upon <hi>all Men</hi> and at <hi>all Times,</hi> that is, in <hi>all</hi> Inſtances of Wrong, it thwart and run Counter to other Duties of our holy Religion. Now in order to our being inform'd of the juſt Limits of this great Duty, we muſt conſider that Injuries may be of three Sorts; affecting either Men's <hi>Perſons,</hi> their <hi>good Names,</hi> or their <hi>Eſtates:</hi> And each of theſe may be either in Danger of <hi>Ruin</hi> by the Injuries of a wicked Man, or only greatly <hi>damag'd;</hi> or the Injury may be but <hi>ſmall</hi> and <hi>trifling,</hi> and ſuch as brings no <hi>conſiderable</hi> and <hi>laſting</hi> Ill Effects along with it.

            <p>But now as for <hi>ſmaller</hi> Injuries in any of theſe Reſpects, ſuch as make no <hi>great</hi> Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in our Circumſtances, and may be born without any <hi>great</hi> Inconvenience; theſe are to be paſs'd by, and the Injury for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given according to the Meaſures before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: And 'tis obſervable that the Inſtances our Saviour makes uſe of in this Matter, are of the leſſer Sort of Injuries, ſuch as a Blow on the Cheek, the taking away of a Garment, and the like; and 'twas for being rigorous about a few <hi>Pence,</hi> that the King in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable was ſo wroth with his Servant: And rather than a Chriſtian ſhould embroil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Law-Suits, and run the Hazard of loſing the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit for ſuch ſmall Matters, he ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Repetition of <hi>ſuch</hi> Injuries. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as Religion is in all Reſpects the greateſt <hi>Prudence,</hi> ſo particularly in forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>litigious</hi> Quarrels, unleſs a Man's <hi>whole</hi> Intereſt, or at leaſt a <hi>great</hi> Part of it be at Stake; for <hi>Law</hi> is now become a <hi>boundleſs Ocean,</hi> and generally very rough and Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſwells Men's Paſſions to an exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Height, and ſhipwrecks their <hi>Charity</hi> as well as their <hi>Eſtates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to thoſe greater Injuries our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our mentions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. of Men's being our <hi>Enemies</hi> profeſs'd, and <hi>hating,</hi> and curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and <hi>deſpitefully</hi> uſing, and <hi>perſecuting</hi> us; Neither he nor his Apoſtles, there or any where elſe forbid Chriſtians endeavouring in a legal Manner to ſecure and defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103289:83"/>and recover their own; but only not to return Evil for Evil, and to be ſo far from Purpoſes of <hi>Revenge</hi> or <hi>retaliating,</hi> ſuch Injuries, as rather to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>bleſs</hi> and <hi>pray for,</hi> and do <hi>good to</hi> upon Occaſion, thoſe that deal ſo maliciouſly by them; and to manage the Suit or Contention with them with <hi>Charity,</hi> having no <hi>Rancour</hi> or <hi>Malice</hi> in their Hearts againſt the <hi>Perſon</hi> of their Adverſary. That is, in ſhort, our holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion does oblige us in <hi>leſſer</hi> Injuries intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both to paſs by the Offence, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the <hi>Offender</hi> according to the Meaſures before deſcribed; but in <hi>greater</hi> Injuries of any Sort, where Ruin or inſupportable Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage will follow, though it permits, nay, obliges to endeavour a legal Reparation, and ſo <hi>not</hi> to forgive the <hi>Offence,</hi> yet Chriſtians muſt as intirely, and according to the ſame Meaſures forgive the <hi>Offender,</hi> as in the ſmalleſt Inſtances of Wrong. And by this Means they will become the Children of their heavenly Father, who though in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Mercy he forgave the World of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and moreover beſtowed on them rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all things to enjoy; yet in the Perſon of his bleſſed Son their Repreſentative, he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely expreſs'd his Diſpleaſure againſt their <hi>Sins,</hi> that they might be deter'd from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in them afreſh, to the <hi>Ruin</hi> of their immortal Souls.</p>
            <p>Beſides thoſe Injuries that terminate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Man's <hi>ſelf</hi> and his own Concerns, there are others done to our <hi>Neighbour</hi> and the

               <hi>Publick,</hi> which muſt not be paſs'd by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out animadverting upon them according to their Deſerts. As for Inſtance, if a bloody Villain murders a Man's Friend or Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or Relation, and he knows who is the Murderer, it may be he <hi>only;</hi> in this Caſe, whatever Inclination he may have to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it, whether out of natural Compaſſion, or Unwillingneſs to be the Occaſion of the Man's Execution, ſince nothing can recall the murder'd Perſon to Life, and the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer may live to repent, or the like: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a Member of Society, and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as much as in him lies, to promote its Safety and Happineſs, which by ſuch Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains is much <hi>diſturb'd</hi> and <hi>leſſen'd,</hi> and would be <hi>ruin'd</hi> ſhould ſuch Men paſs <hi>unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd;</hi> 'tis his Duty to endeavour by all lawful Means to bring ſo heinous an Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to condign Puniſhment, that ſo <hi>corrupt</hi> a Member being cut off from the Community, the Health of the whole may be better ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd. And ſo in all Caſes of the like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Always remembring that if any thing of <hi>private Revenge</hi> be intermix'd, it pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes the Action, and makes the Man doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty of <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What has been hitherto ſaid concerning the <hi>Limits</hi> of <hi>forgiving Injuries,</hi> concerns Men only as <hi>private</hi> Perſons: As for <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> and <hi>Governours,</hi> they being conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God to be <hi>a Terror to evil doers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.3, 4.</note> to be <hi>Revengers to execute Wrath upon them,</hi> and to <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>encourage</hi> thoſe only that do
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103289:84"/>
               <hi>well;</hi> the Meaſure of their Forgiveneſs of publick Injuries, is the publick Good; ſo far as is conſiſtent with their Obligations as Magiſtrates, as is conducive to the common <hi>Weal,</hi> according to the Judgment of <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>unprejudic'd Reaſon,</hi> they <hi>may,</hi> and do <hi>well</hi> to incline to Lenity and Compaſſion; but a <hi>fooliſh</hi> and a <hi>mercenary</hi> Pity is a betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Truſt, a <hi>bearing the Sword in vain;</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> Magiſtrates, inſtead of being <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> of their Country, are indeed the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious <hi>Deſtroyers</hi> of it. And thus much for the Nature of chriſtian <hi>Forgiveneſs of Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> in Imitation of the divine Pattern God has ſet us, with its general Limits.</p>
            <p>As for the great <hi>Obligation</hi> we have to <hi>copy</hi> after this admirable Pattern of our merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heavenly Father; it is twofold. (1) With Reſpect to <hi>God,</hi> (2) to our <hi>Selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, With Reſpect to <hi>God,</hi> our Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to forgive <hi>one another</hi> as he has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given us is very great, becauſe 'tis what he has declared will be highly <hi>pleaſing</hi> to him, as a Reſemblance of that Perfection of his Nature which he ſeems moſt of all to take <hi>Delight</hi> in. For ſo, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. when <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee his <hi>Glory,</hi> he told him he would make all his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> paſs before him; and Chap. 34.6. The Lord paſſed by before him and proclaimed, <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, abundant in Goodneſs and Truth, keeping Mercy for Thouſands, forgiving Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin.</hi> And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103289:85"/>St. <hi>John</hi> gives the Definition of him, <hi>God is Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now certainly, thoſe that have receiv'd ſuch infinite Favours from this good God, and have been forgiven ſo <hi>vaſt</hi> a Debt, as we ſinners have; have the greateſt Reaſon in the World to endeavour to the utmoſt of their Power, to pleaſe this their greateſt Benefactor in every thing: And nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more pleaſing to him than to ſee the Image and Reflection of his divine <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Philanthropy</hi> upon the Souls of his Creatures, to ſee 'em love and compaſſionate one another according to his glorious Example; we are infinitely obliged to imitate his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Forgiveneſs towards <hi>us,</hi> in paſſing by the Offences of our <hi>Fellow-Servants.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thoſe to whom God has forgiven ſo vaſt a Debt as that which miſerable Sinners ow'd to the divine Juſtice, are queſtionleſs bound, and that with the ſtricteſt Ties to love him infinitely again; but now St. <hi>John</hi> ſays plainly,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.20, 21.</note> that <hi>he that loves God muſt love his Brother alſo, and if a Man ſay, I love God, and yet hateth his Brother, he is a Lyar, and the Truth is not in him:</hi> For as he ſays, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.17. <hi>He that ſhutteth up his Bowels of Compaſſion from his Brother, how dwelleth the Love of God in him?</hi> And therefore, as much as we are bound to love our <hi>good God,</hi> who has forgiven us our <hi>numberleſs Iniquities,</hi> ſo much are we bound to <hi>manifeſt</hi> that our Love to him, by being pitiful and gentle to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103289:85"/>our <hi>brethren</hi> that have injur'd <hi>us,</hi> and ready to <hi>forgive</hi> them: For <hi>ſo</hi> ſays our Lord, ſhall ye be my <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and <hi>ſo</hi> ſhall ye be the <hi>Children</hi> of your <hi>Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And doubtleſs that wicked Servant in the Parable, had not ſo due an Apprehenſion of his Lord's great Compaſſion to <hi>him,</hi> nor ſo <hi>grateful</hi> a Senſe of it as he ought to have had, who could immediately forget the miſerable Condition he was ſo lately in <hi>himſelf,</hi> and how much he dreaded leſt his Lord ſhould rigidly exact his great Debt of him, and how importunately he begg'd that he would have Patience with him:; and yet uſe ſo much Cruelty to his Fellow-Servant for a Debt very inconſiderable. He could not but know that ſuch <hi>Barbarity</hi> would be very contrary to the compaſſionate Temper of his Lord; and therefore was bound in <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi> if upon no other Account, to imitate his Lord's Example, and not immediately act what would be ſo diſpleaſing to him. And ſo it is in our Caſe; God is <hi>Love,</hi> and has wondrouſly <hi>manifeſted</hi> his Love in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving us miſerable Sinners; and therefore we are bound, in <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and becauſe 'twill be <hi>pleaſing</hi> to him, were that all, to imitate that his Charity, and mutually to love and forgive one another. But when beſides, we have our Saviour's expreſs <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> for it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.37. and that, <hi>not until ſeven times only, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſeventy times ſeven,</hi> as in the Verſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Parable: As much as Men are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103289:86"/>obliged to obey the Commands of God their Saviour, ſo ſtrong is their Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to forgive Injuries with Reſpect to <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Our Obligation is very great to imitate God's compaſſionate Example, with reſpect to our <hi>ſelves.</hi> For 'tis the beſt Way to <hi>ſecure Quiet,</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and as much as every Man is bound to provide for his own Quiet, and the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> of <hi>Society,</hi> and of his own Soul too in the other World; ſo much is every Man bound not to be malicious and revengeful, but of a Temper ready to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For however <hi>ſweet</hi> Revenge may ſeem to be to malicious Spirits in the <hi>Execution,</hi> it muſt needs make the Mind very <hi>uneaſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> 'tis executed, and bring great Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties along with it <hi>afterward,</hi> and is the moſt baſe <hi>devilliſh</hi> Temper in the World, and makes a Man a <hi>Fiend incarnate.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as an Aptneſs to <hi>forgive,</hi> is a <hi>Godlike</hi> Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, for God is <hi>Love,</hi> the <hi>Spring</hi> of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Compaſſion, of Mercy and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and as <hi>his</hi> Happineſs is the Reſult of the Excellencies and Perfections of his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> ſo thoſe who reſemble him in the moſt <hi>glorious</hi> of thoſe Perfections, muſt needs likewiſe enjoy a great Share of Tranquillity and inward Bliſs. But if <hi>God</hi> be the great Exemplar of <hi>Forgiveneſs,</hi> how groundleſs is the uſual Objection againſt this excellent Vertue of Chriſtianity, that it betrays a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103289:86"/>
               <hi>mean ſervile</hi> Spirit, and is a thing much <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> a <hi>Gentleman!</hi> Can any Man of common Senſe think it a Diſgrace to be like <hi>God,</hi> and that in his moſt <hi>glorious</hi> Perfection too? If God be the Fountain of Honour, we muſt allow it to be rather, the moſt <hi>noble generous</hi> Action in the World.</p>
            <p>It is the beſt Way likewiſe of <hi>ending</hi> Strifes, and <hi>overcoming</hi> our Adverſaries by rendring <hi>Good</hi> for <hi>Evil.</hi> It eaſes the Mind of thoſe great <hi>Diſquietudes</hi> that conſtantly attend Deſires of Revenge; it prevents all the Miſchiefs that <hi>follow</hi> it, ſuch as <hi>freſh</hi> Injuries from the Party we revenge our ſelves upon, if we leave him his Life, and the Stroke of Juſtice if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue him to the Death. But beſides theſe evil Conſequences of Revenge, and many others which <hi>Forgiveneſs prevents,</hi> there is more true <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> in the <hi>Act</hi> of Forgiveneſs and <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> as was hinted above, than in that of <hi>Revenge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For however the Devil may hurry Men on in an eager Perſuit of Revenge, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 'em with the Hopes of great <hi>Satisfaction</hi> when 'tis <hi>perfected;</hi> yet there is a ſecret <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> and <hi>Averſion</hi> to it from <hi>within,</hi> which, as 'twere pulls <hi>back</hi> the Hand when going to ſtrike; or what other way ſoever it be expreſſed, endeavours to <hi>hinder</hi> it, and makes the Heart recoil and repent of the Undertaking, and <hi>execute</hi> it with <hi>trembling</hi> and miſgivings of Soul; and immediately <hi>after,</hi> come dire Forebodings of the Venge
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103289:87"/>ance of him to whom Vengeance belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and a Kind of Hell upon Earth. But <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> is attended with <hi>Applauſes</hi> of Conſcience, and the <hi>Approbation</hi> of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Chearfulneſs</hi> of Spirit: There is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Pleaſure and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Mind quite throughout the Action, and when 'tis <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated,</hi> no Man can expreſs the ſilent <hi>Joy</hi> that runs through the whole Soul, and it ſeems a Foretaſte of the Joys of the Bleſſed in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even that Part of Forgiveneſs which ſeems moſt of all impracticable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Fleſh and Blood, that of <hi>ſuing</hi> to a Man to be reconciled that has <hi>done</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and ſtill <hi>continues</hi> to be one's Enemy; <hi>this</hi> does of all yeild the <hi>greateſt</hi> Pleaſure to the Soul: And that, not only becauſe 'tis the <hi>neareſt</hi> Reſemblance to the Mercy of <hi>God,</hi> who ſent his Son to mediate between him and us, and by his Death to reconcile us to himſelf, when 'twas <hi>we</hi> miſerable Wretches that had <hi>offended,</hi> and were then in <hi>actual</hi> Rebellion againſt him; but from the Nature of the thing <hi>it ſelf.</hi> For 'tis a kind of <hi>ſurprizing</hi> a Man into Charity before he is <hi>aware.</hi> When Men <hi>do</hi> Injuries, they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſtand upon their <hi>Defence</hi> and expect to <hi>receive</hi> Injuries again; but when a Man finds, inſtead of this, Acts of Friendſhip and Good will, and Readineſs to forgive, and Peace and Quietneſs <hi>offer'd</hi> ſo <hi>freely,</hi> and upon ſuch eaſie Terms, without the <hi>Shame</hi> and natural Regret in <hi>ſeeking</hi> it, and <hi>asking</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:103289:87"/>Pardon, and making <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and the like: How pleas'd muſt the Man needs be, to find a <hi>Friend,</hi> when he fear'd and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted an Enemy? Few Men love Strife for <hi>Strife's Sake,</hi> and many a Man injures ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſuddain <hi>Heat</hi> and Paſſion, and in cooler Blood <hi>repents</hi> of it, though he can't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with himſelf to <hi>ask Forgiveneſs:</hi> And ſometimes a Man injures another in retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating ſomething that he took amiſs from <hi>him,</hi> though perhaps far otherwiſe <hi>intended;</hi> and it may be <hi>falſe Reports</hi> may have made the Difference. But now, <hi>this</hi> Way of Reconciliation preſently ſets all right again; it creates a right Underſtanding between Party and Party, it nips Quarrels in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Bud,</hi> and leaves no Room for further Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Ill Will. And what a holy <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph</hi> will there then be in the forgiving Soul, thus to have ſoftned his Enemy, and overcome <hi>Evil</hi> with Good!</p>
            <p>And ſuch <hi>happy Effects</hi> of Forgiveneſs of Injuries as theſe, methinks ſhould engage every conſidering Man to put it in <hi>Practice,</hi> were this <hi>all;</hi> but when beſides all this ſo great a Mercy as the perfect Recovery of the Favour of <hi>God,</hi> the Forgiveneſs of our <hi>own vaſt</hi> Debt, and the Enjoyment of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Felicities of <hi>Heaven</hi> ſhall be the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> of it; Surely no Man in his Wits, but muſt think himſelf as much obliged to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Injuries,</hi> as to make himſelf eternally happy if he can. And that this exceeding great <hi>Reward</hi> ſhall attend the hearty Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103289:88"/>of this <hi>Vertue,</hi> is plain from our Lord's own Words, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.37. <hi>Forgive, and ye ſhall be forgiven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, as it appears from what has been ſaid, that we have upon all Accounts great <hi>Obligation</hi> to imitate the compaſſionate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our merciful God; ſo in the</p>
            <p>Second Place, Our <hi>Baſeneſs</hi> will be very great if we do <hi>not:</hi> And that both with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God and Man. With Reſpect to <hi>God,</hi> not to forgive a <hi>petty</hi> Injury from our Brother, when God has forgiven ſuch <hi>infinite</hi> Provocations as ours againſt <hi>himſelf,</hi> is the vileſt <hi>Baſeneſs,</hi> becauſe, as was ſaid before, 'tis the vileſt <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> and <hi>Forgetfulneſs</hi> of his great Mercy to us. I ſay a <hi>petty</hi> Injury from our Brother; for <hi>every</hi> Injury, how great ſoever, that one Mortal can do to another, is indeed, but of <hi>no regard,</hi> in compare with thoſe mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Heaps of Wickedneſſes which we have been guilty of againſt God; and bear not ſo great Proportion to them, as an <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pence</hi> does to <hi>Ten Thouſand Talents;</hi> as the Parable expreſſes both Debts, that which the compaſſionate <hi>King</hi> forgave his <hi>Servant,</hi> and that which that <hi>wicked Man</hi> would not forgive his <hi>Fellow-Servant.</hi> The infinite Goodneſs of God to <hi>us,</hi> if it has made its due Impreſſion upon our Spirits, will leave ſo charming an Idea of Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon our Souls, as will incline us to a ſuitable Practice upon all Occaſions, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince we know from God's great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103289:88"/>towards us, how <hi>pleaſing</hi> to him Compaſſion is in others. But, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God's unſpeakable Kindneſs to <hi>us,</hi> to cheriſh a Temper of Mind which we can't but be ſenſible he <hi>infinitely Hates,</hi> and endeavour to make thoſe miſerable as far as our Malice will reach, to whom <hi>God</hi> has forgiven as much as he forgave <hi>us,</hi> and for whoſe Redemption Chriſt dyed, and for whom are reſerv'd Crowns of Glory in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, through the wondrous Mercy of God; and all this unmercifulneſs for a <hi>ſmall</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the Debt of a few <hi>Pence:</hi> This ſhews the baſeſt of <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> and <hi>weak</hi> Senſe of God's Compaſſion ſhewn to us, that is poſſible. Well may our Lord ſay to ſuch Men, with a little Variation, as the King in the Parable ſaid to that cruel Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of his; <hi>O thou wicked Servant, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave thee all that Debt, and that though thou didſt not deſire it of me; ſhouldſt not thou alſo have had Compaſſion on thy Fellow-Servant, even as I had Pity on thee? Obligation</hi> ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent there was no Doubt; and that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, and Forgetfulneſs of God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and his cruel hardned Temper was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry provoking will appear in the Sequel. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, To be revengeful and implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble after ſuch Mercy receiv'd our <hi>ſelves,</hi> is the greateſt Baſeneſs with Reſpect to <hi>Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For we are all <hi>Fellow-Servants</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> great <hi>Lord;</hi> and his <hi>Mercy</hi> has been the <hi>ſame</hi> to all of us; we are all of us through Chriſt, under the ſame Covenant of Grace and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation:</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:103289:89"/>Now <hi>this</hi> methinks ſhould <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear</hi> us to one another, and our mutual Joy for each others Happineſs, ſhould put an End to all other <hi>petty</hi> Quarrels and <hi>Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities</hi> between us.

               <hi>Laſt</hi> Place to conſider the miſerable <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence</hi> of this Baſeneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> We ſhall thereby provoke God to <hi>recall</hi> his Pardon to <hi>us,</hi> and deal with us as the King in the Parable did with his wicked ungrateful and cruel Servant, <hi>and deliver us over to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors, till we ſhall have paid all that is due unto him. For ſo likewiſe,</hi> ſays our Lord, <hi>ſhall my heavenly Father do unto you, if ye
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103289:89"/>from your Hearts forgive not every one his Brother their Treſpaſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God's Pardon to Sinners, though it be very <hi>full</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> and given in infinite <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> yet is not paſs'd in ſuch a Manner as that it can never be <hi>revok'd;</hi> 'twas given at <hi>firſt</hi> upon <hi>Conditions,</hi> and may be again <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited</hi> if we fail of performing what God <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,</hi> in order to his final <hi>ratifying</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Forgiveneſs of Injuries</hi> is expreſly mention'd by our Saviour, as Part of what God expects from us in order to his <hi>comfirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> his Pardon to us; for thus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>If ye forgive Men their Treſpaſſes, your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father will alſo forgive you; but if ye forgive not Men their Treſpaſſes, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your Treſpaſſes;</hi> but, as 'tis in the Parable, his Wrath will again wax hot againſt you, and he will make void his former Pardon, and <hi>deliver you over to the Tormentors till you ſhall pay all that is due unto him.</hi> That is, will conſign you to the Portion of the Devil and his Angels, Spirits of like malicious and revengeful Tempers, who, as the <hi>mercileſs</hi> Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of God's Vengeance, will not for ever ſpare to torment and cruciate thoſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souls, who might have eſcap'd thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and had their Pardon <hi>ſeal'd</hi> with the Blood of their Redeemer, but <hi>forfeited</hi> it again by indulging to that devilliſh Temper of <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Revenge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, to conclude this Parable. If we are touch'd with a due Senſe of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103289:90"/>wondrous Compaſſion of God to us miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sinners in forgiving us the vaſt Debt we had contracted to the divine Juſtice by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our Sins, and which 'twas impoſſible for us ever to have diſcharg'd our ſelves; whereby we are deliver'd from the intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and endleſs <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of them; and moreover made <hi>Sons of God,</hi> and Heirs of celeſtial Glory: If we are duly touch'd with a Senſe of this infinite Goodneſs of God to <hi>us</hi> (which to effect was the Endeavour of the <hi>firſt</hi> Part of this Diſcourſe) let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our deep Reſentment of his gracious Forgiveneſs of <hi>us,</hi> by imitating ſo excellent an Example, and <hi>forgiving one another.</hi> Let us conſider the great <hi>Happineſs,</hi> that both here and hereafter will attend the Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Duty; and reflect upon the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Miſery that will cloſely follow the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

                  </bibl>
                  <p>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a certain King,
<note place="margin">Mat. 22.2.</note> that made a Marriage for his Son,</p>
                  <p>And ſent forth his Servants to call them that were bidden to the Wedding: And they would not come.</p>
                  <p>And they all with one conſent began to make Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe:
<note place="margin">Luk. 14.18.</note> The firſt ſaid unto him, I have bought a Piece of Ground, and I muſt needs go and ſee it; I pray thee have me excuſed.</p>
                  <p>And another ſaid, I have bought five Yoke of Oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excuſed.</p>
                  <p>And another ſaid, I have married a Wife, and therefore I cannot come.</p>
                  <p>Again he ſent forth other Servants,
<note place="margin">Mat. 22.4.</note> ſaying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold I have prepared my Dinner: my Oxen and my Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103289:92"/>are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the Marriage.</p>
                  <p>But they made light of it, and went their Ways, one to his Farm, another to his Merchandiſe:</p>
                  <p>And the Remnant took his Servants, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them ſpitefully, and ſlew them.</p>
                  <p>But when the King heard thereof, he was wroth: And he ſent forth his Armies, and deſtroyed thoſe Murderers, and burnt up their City.</p>
                  <p>Then ſaith he to his Servants, the Wedding is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but thoſe that were bidden were not worthy.</p>
                  <p>Go ye therefore into the High-ways, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as ye ſhall find, bid to the Marriage.</p>
                  <p>So thoſe Servants went out into the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and gathered together all, as many as they found, both bad and good: and the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was furniſh'd with Gueſts.</p>
                  <p>And when the King came in to ſee the Gueſts, he ſaw there a Man that had not on a wedding Garment:</p>
                  <p>And he ſaith unto him, Friend, how cameſt thou in hither, not having a wedding Garment? And he was ſpeechleſs.</p>
                  <p>Then ſaid the King to the Servants, Bind him Hand and Foot, and take him away and caſt him into outer Darkneſs: There ſhall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnaſhing of Teeth.</p>
                  <p>For many are called, but few are choſen.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS Parable, I ſuppoſe, was in its <hi>firſt</hi> Intention, deſign'd to reprove the hardned <hi>Infidelity</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> their obſtinately <hi>rejecting</hi> the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God to them in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and their
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103289:93"/>vile <hi>Ingratitude</hi> to him for his <hi>peculiar</hi> Care of them, in ſo ordering it, that the Goſpel ſhould be <hi>firſt</hi> preach'd to <hi>them</hi> (to which Purpoſe alſo was ſpoken the Parable of the wicked Husbandmen in <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.33. which, for its great Affinity to the firſt Part of this Parable, and intire Relation to the Jews, I thought fit to paſs by) and it was likewiſe intended to ſhew God's great <hi>Anger</hi> againſt them for that their <hi>Stubbornneſs</hi> and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Treatment of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and how ſad the Conſequence of it would be, both in this World and the next: And withall, to declare God's Purpoſe of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Gentiles</hi> into the Fold of Chriſt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>their</hi> deſpiſing and rejecting that ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Favour, and moreover, that <hi>whoever</hi> makes Profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> muſt <hi>live</hi> agreeably, and be conformable to all its holy Laws, or elſe their Condition will be more deplorable than ever. This, I think was the <hi>firſt</hi> Intention of this Parable.</p>
            <p>But beſides this, it has another Aſpect which is intirely <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and is full of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof and Inſtruction to us that have <hi>alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> embrac'd the Diſcipline of Chriſt, and is very aptly expreſſive of theſe Four things, which I ſhall make the Subject of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is lively expreſſive of the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> or Chriſtian Religion, as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it by the <hi>Marriage of a King's Son,</hi> and the <hi>poor</hi> and the <hi>maim'd,</hi> the <hi>halt</hi> and the <hi>blind</hi> being call'd in to partake of the <hi>Wedding Supper.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> of God's great Care in having this Religion <hi>publiſh'd</hi> and made known to <hi>all Men,</hi> and his repeated <hi>Invitations</hi> to all Men to <hi>embrace</hi> it; repreſented by that King's <hi>ſending forth his Servants to call them that were bidden to the Wedding, and again ſending forth other Servants, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to tell thoſe that were bidden that he had prepar'd and made all things ready, and therefore to urge them to come unto the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It very aptly expreſſes, what kind of <hi>Reception,</hi> this <hi>holy Religion,</hi> and the Teachers of it are like to meet with in the World; repreſented here by Men's making <hi>light</hi> of the Invitation to the Marriage of the King's Son, and offering <hi>Excuſes,</hi> ſuch as, of having <hi>bought a Piece of Ground,</hi> and a <hi>Yoke of Oxen,</hi> and of having <hi>married a Wife,</hi> and that theſe things would engage their Time, and therefore they could not come: And accordingly, going their own Way, <hi>one to his Farm,</hi> and <hi>another</hi> to his <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe,</hi> and the reſt taking thoſe Servants that came to invite them, and <hi>intreating them ſpitefully, and ſlaying them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It expreſſes how ſad their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition will be, that either when they are invited to, yet <hi>reject</hi> this holy Religion, and abuſe the Preachers of it; or elſe, though they do <hi>profeſs</hi> it, yet <hi>live</hi> not <hi>agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> to it. The <hi>latter</hi> of which is repreſented by the King's finding a Man at the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Supper that had not on a <hi>Wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:103289:94"/>and ſaying unto him, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou in hither not having on a Wedding Garment?</hi> And the Man's being <hi>ſpeechleſs</hi> upon it, and the King's commanding his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <hi>to bind him Hand and Foot and take him away, and caſt him into outer Darkneſs, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth:</hi> And the <hi>former</hi> is expreſs'd by the King's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wroth with thoſe that <hi>ſtighted</hi> his Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and pronouncing them <hi>not worthy</hi> of it, and reſolving that they ſhould not <hi>taſte of his Supper,</hi> and ſending his Servants to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite <hi>others</hi> to the Wedding, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Armies to go forth and <hi>deſtroy thoſe Murderers,</hi> that had ſpitefully entreated and ſlain his Servants, and to <hi>burn up their City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then after all, there is a general Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation drawn from hence, namely, <hi>That many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> Of each of theſe I ſhall diſcourſe in their Order.</p>
            <p>Firſt, this Parable does very <hi>lively</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> or Chriſtian Religion; repreſented here by <hi>the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of a King's Son,</hi> and the <hi>poor</hi> and the <hi>maim'd,</hi> the <hi>halt</hi> and the <hi>blind</hi> being call'd in as Gueſts to partake of the <hi>Wedding Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Goſpel or Chriſtian Religion makes the ſame <hi>Relation</hi> between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Believers,</hi> as <hi>Marriage</hi> does be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Wife, i. e.</hi> the <hi>neareſt,</hi> the <hi>deareſt,</hi> and likewiſe an <hi>inſeparable Relation:</hi> For, that Marriage is the <hi>neareſt</hi> Relation, is evident from what is ſaid <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.24, that a Man ſhall <hi>leave Father and Mother, and cleave to his Wife;</hi> 'tis the <hi>deareſt</hi> Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe a Man's Wife is as <hi>himſelf, Bone of his Bone, and Fleſh of his Fleſh,</hi> as <hi>Eve</hi> was of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>no Man</hi> ever yet <hi>hated</hi> his <hi>own Fleſh</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul has it)</hi> but <hi>nouriſheth and cheriſheth it; and Men ought to love their Wives as their own Bodies;</hi> and he that <hi>loveth his Wife ſtill loveth himſelf:</hi> And 'tis an <hi>inſeparable</hi> Relation likewiſe; for though <hi>God</hi> permitted <hi>Divorce</hi> to the <hi>Jews</hi> for the Hardneſs of their Hearts, and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in ſome Caſes, and for the ſame Reaſon permits it to us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> yet from the <hi>Beginning</hi> it was not ſo; and thoſe whom

            <p>In like manner, the Goſpel or Chriſtian Religion does (1.) create the <hi>neareſt</hi> Relation between Chriſt and Believers; it makes us <hi>Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones;</hi> and as was before quoted from St. <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 5.30. <hi>i. e.</hi> it makes us as <hi>near</hi> to him as the <hi>Members</hi> are to the <hi>Head,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Bones</hi> to the <hi>Body;</hi> or as our Church expreſſes it, it makes us <hi>one with Chriſt and Chriſt with us;</hi> 'tis <hi>ſo</hi> near a Relation that nothing can ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it but what expreſſes an <hi>Union.</hi> It cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates likewiſe (2.) the <hi>deareſt</hi> Relation, for thus our Lord, <hi>John</hi> 14.21. <hi>He that hath my Commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him and will manifeſt my ſelf unto him;</hi> and Verſ. 23. <hi>We will come unto him and make our Abode with him;</hi> and Chap. 15.14. <hi>Ye are my Friends if ye do whatſoever I command you.</hi> And <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſays our Lord, <hi>I ſtand at the Door and knock; if any Man hear my Voice and open the Door, i. e.</hi> by Faith and Obedience, <hi>I will come in unto him, and ſup with him and he with me;</hi> he will ſhew the greateſt Expreſſions of Dearneſs and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to him. And as the Goſpel makes the <hi>neareſt</hi> and <hi>deareſt</hi> Relation between Chriſt and Believers, ſo that Relation is (3.) <hi>inſeparable; i. e.</hi> unleſs we willfully <hi>divorce
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103289:96"/>our ſelves</hi> from him by <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> or <hi>Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> Thus a little before his Aſcenſion he tells his Apoſtles, and in them all faithful Believers that obſerve whatſoever he hath commanded, that he will be <hi>with them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, even to the End of the World:</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was to aſcend to <hi>his</hi> Father and <hi>their</hi> Father, to <hi>his</hi> God and <hi>their</hi> God, therefore ſays he, <hi>I will not leave you comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but will pray to the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, John</hi> 14.16. and in the 2. and 3. Verſes of that Chapter, <hi>I go to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Place for you, and if I go and prepare a Place for you, I will come again and receive you to my ſelf, that where I am, there ye may be alſo.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 10.27, 28. <hi>My Sheep hear my Voice and I know them and they follow me; and I give unto them E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of my Hand.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> with great Aſſurance asks this Queſtion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the Love of Chriſt?</hi> and after enumerating what in the Eſteem of the World was moſt likely to do it, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, Verſ. the laſt, that <hi>nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the Love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> And he is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Manner always with us in the Reception of thoſe Myſteries which he inſtituted in <hi>Remembrance</hi> of him.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel then, effecting ſo <hi>near,</hi> ſo <hi>dear,</hi> and ſo <hi>inſeparable</hi> a Relation between
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103289:96"/>Chriſt and Believers, that nothing can ſo fitly reſemble it as the State of <hi>Marriage;</hi> we may from hence collect in the next place, what <hi>Privileges</hi> the Goſpel intitles Believers to, by reaſon of this their ſo <hi>intimate</hi> Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>firſt,</hi> it intitles to the peculiar <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> of Chriſt, ſuch a Love as will incline him to promote the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of Believers, and to <hi>pity</hi> and compaſſionate their <hi>Infirmities,</hi> Failures and Imperfections; for Love covereth a Multitude of Faults<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Husbands love your Wives, and be not bitter againſt them;</hi> be not extreme to obſerve every little Defect and Failing in them, but conſider 'em as the weaker Veſſel, and bear with their Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And accordingly the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſays of our Lord, he is not one that cannot be touch'd with a Senſe of our Infirmities, but knows and pities them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been in all Points tempted as we are, though without Sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. And as for his <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> and Care of our <hi>Happineſs,</hi> 'tis miraculouſly evident in that <hi>he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us,</hi> ſacrific'd his very <hi>Life</hi> for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to his offended Father, <hi>that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe us, and preſent us to himſelf a glorious Church, not having Spot or Wrinkle or any ſuch thing, but that we ſhould be holy and without Blemiſh;</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſes it in the before cited <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he does continually <hi>nouriſh</hi> and <hi>che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi> us by the Communications of his Grace
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103289:97"/>in the bleſſed Sacrament (that ſpiritual Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his, <hi>which whoſo eateth of ſhall live for ever</hi>) and by the Comforts and Aſſiſtances of his holy Spirit. And to lye thus in the Boſome of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> to have ſuch great Degrees of his Love and Tenderneſs to us expreſs'd in ſuch <hi>amazing</hi> Inſtances; to be thus <hi>pitied</hi> and commiſerated, and our Failures excus'd and <hi>paſt by,</hi> by him that is to be our <hi>Judge;</hi> and our <hi>Happineſs</hi> in all Reſpects ſo carefully endeavoured by <hi>him</hi> who is the <hi>Fountain</hi> of it: This is ſuch a Privilege as can never be enough valu'd, and is infinitely above the Reach of any Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>
            <p>Another Privilege the Goſpel intitles Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to upon their ſo near Relation to Chriſt, is Chriſt's <hi>Protection</hi> of them from <hi>Dangers,</hi> and <hi>Defence</hi> againſt <hi>Aſſaults of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> For, as in Marriage, the Husband is the Shield and <hi>Guardian</hi> of his Wife, ſo Chriſt is the <hi>Protector</hi> and Defender of the faithful; he covers them from the Rage and Malice of unreaſonable <hi>Men,</hi> and arms them againſt the Attacks of the Spirits of Darkneſs, by the Supplies and Aids of his bleſſed Spirit; <hi>who helps our Infirmities, and ſtrengthens us mightily in the inner Man,</hi> ſo that the Gates of Hell, all the infernal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhall not be able to prevail againſt us. And accordingly, ſays St. <hi>Paul, I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me, Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. <hi>In all theſe things, Tribulation, Diſtreſs, Perſecution, Famine,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:103289:97"/>Nakedneſs, Perilor Sword, in all theſe things we are more than Conquerers.</hi> By what means? Why, <hi>through Chriſt that loveth us.</hi> And our Lord ſays expreſly in the forecited <hi>John</hi> 10.27. <hi>my Sheep that hear my Voice ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of my Hand.</hi> And if the Almighty Son of God be for us, and takes us into his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and ſhields and guards us as a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band does the Wiſe of his Boſome; who then can be againſt us? <hi>We ſhall be hid under his Wings, and ſafe under his Feathers, his Faithfulneſs and Truth ſhall be our Shield and Buckler.</hi> And, <hi>to dwell thus under the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the moſt High, and abide under the Shadow of the Allmighty,</hi> is, no doubt, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Privilege.</p>
            <p>Again, as the Husband confers <hi>Honour</hi> upon his Wife, intitles <hi>her</hi> to have a Share in that Honour that is due to <hi>him;</hi> ſo Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, by their intimate Union with Chriſt, are advanc'd to the <hi>higheſt</hi> Step of Honour that <hi>Mortals</hi> can arrive at: For, what more honourable than to be in ſo near a Relation to the moſt glorious Son of God! Accordingly the Scripture exhorts us to walk <hi>worthy</hi> of our holy Profeſſion, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.1.

               <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is a moſt <hi>honourable</hi> Profeſſion, and what <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul,</hi> when he offered him his eldeſt Daughter to Wife for his great Services;

But,</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, the Goſpel intitles Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as to a Participation in ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the <hi>Honour</hi> of Chriſt, ſo likewiſe of his <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Happineſs.</hi> And, as a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is to provide for his <hi>Wife</hi> ſuitable to his <hi>own Quality,</hi> and make her a Sharer in his Happineſs and <hi>Proſperity;</hi> ſo will Chriſt confer upon ſincere Believers a <hi>plentiful Share</hi> of his <hi>Glories</hi> and <hi>Felicities</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus,
<note place="margin">John 14.2, 3.</note> a little before his Paſſion, <hi>in my Father's Houſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are many Manſions, and I go to prepare a Place for you; and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to my ſelf, that where I am there ye may be alſo.</hi> And in that ſolemn Prayer to his heavenly Father, <hi>John</hi> 17.22. <hi>The Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> ſays he, <hi>which thou gaveſt me I have given them;</hi> and Verſ. 24. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me be with me where I am, that they may behold thy Glory
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103289:98"/>which thou haſt given me, i. e.</hi> may ſhare in the Beatifick Viſion, which is the <hi>Summit</hi> of all Happineſs. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays <hi>we are joint Heirs with Chriſt, and if we ſuffer with him, i.e.</hi> ſtill continue faithful Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers notwithſtanding the Diſcouragements and Temptations of the World, <hi>we ſhall be glorified together.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23. Chriſt is call'd the <hi>firſt Fruits</hi> of a glorious Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to immortal Bliſs, which ſuppoſes a general Harveſt to follow <hi>Chriſt the firſt Fruits, afterwards thoſe that are Chriſt's at his coming. For the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a Shout, with the Voice of the Arch-Augel, and with the Trump of God, and the Dead in Chriſt ſhall be raiſed firſt; then we which are alive and remain ſhall be caught up together with them in the Clouds, and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16.17. And if to all this we add, that this intimate Union of Believers with Chriſt, as of a Wife with her Husband, and theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Privileges that are conſequent upon it, will be <hi>everlaſting;</hi> that <hi>nothing</hi> can put <hi>a-ſunder</hi> whom God has in infinite Mercy joyn'd thus <hi>cloſe together,</hi> but our wilful Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs to this our divine Husband: As it will make up the Account of the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of God's Love to the Children of Men, and ſhould in Return, make <hi>us</hi> all over Love and Gratitude to that good God who hath done ſuch great things for us; ſo it ſhould make us exceeding careful upon no Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations whatever to divorce our ſelves from
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:103289:99"/>this our glorious Husband, but for ever pay all poſſible Love and dutiful Obedience to him. Which brings me in the next Place to ſhew, that as the Goſpel effects the ſame <hi>Relation</hi> between Chriſt and Believers as Marriage does between a Man and his Wife, and intitles to the like <hi>Privileges;</hi> ſo it obliges likewiſe to the like <hi>Duties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> As a <hi>Wife</hi> is bound to bear <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Love</hi> and <hi>Fidelity</hi> to her <hi>Husband,</hi> ſo is every <hi>Believer</hi> bound to demean himſelf towards <hi>Chriſt.</hi> That is, to love him above all things, and to be <hi>intirely his;</hi> not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his Affections to wander after <hi>ſtrange</hi> Loves, ſuch as the <hi>World</hi> and the Vanities of <hi>it;</hi> not to be debauch'd by the Devil and his Temptations, and ſhare his Heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial:</hi> But, ſince <hi>his Maker is his Husband,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 54.5.</note> as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> expreſſes it, to be intirely faithful to him, and admit no Creature to that Dearneſs of Affection which he alone ſhould have</p>
            <p>For this is that Crime which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls ſpiritual <hi>Fornication</hi> and <hi>Adultery,</hi> and which St. <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he began to fear they were guilty of; <hi>I am jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous over you,</hi> ſays he, <hi>with a Godly Jealouſie, for I have eſpous'd you to one Husband, that I may preſent you as a chaſte Virgin unto Chriſt: But I fear, leſt by any means, as the Serpent beguiled</hi> Eve <hi>through his Subtilty, ſo your Minds ſhould be corrupted from the Simplicity,</hi> or Purity and Integrity, <hi>that is towards Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1, 2. This is that <hi>Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:103289:99"/>for which Chriſt will give us a Bill of Divorcement, and for ever put us away from him; <hi>depart from me ye curſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. This is in a ſpiritual Senſe, <hi>to take the Members of Chriſt and make them the Members of an Harlot;</hi> and theſe <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> as well as <hi>carnal Whoremongers and Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, God will judge.</hi> And therefore, as much as it concerns us to <hi>continue</hi> in this near and deareſt Relation to Chriſt, which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſuch ineſtimable Privileges; ſo much it concerns us to bear an <hi>intire</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted</hi> Love to him; <hi>for he hath hought us with a Price, therefore we ſhould glorifie him in our Bodies and our Spirits which are his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As a Wife is bound to <hi>ſubmit</hi> her ſelf to her Husband, to <hi>comply</hi> with his <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> his <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Authority;</hi> ſo, and much <hi>more</hi> is every <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever</hi> bound to do to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> That is, to be <hi>ſatisfied</hi> with the Diſpoſals of his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to his <hi>Guidance</hi> and <hi>Conduct,</hi> to <hi>reverence</hi> all the Expreſſes of his <hi>good Pleaſure,</hi> to be in <hi>Subjection</hi> to his holy <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,</hi> to have one <hi>Will</hi> with him, the ſame Likes and Diſlikes, and in no Caſe to oppoſe or reſiſt his Sovereign Authority.</p>
            <p>This is no more than what the Apoſtles command from a <hi>Woman</hi> to her <hi>Husband,</hi> (as every one that has read their Writings knows very well) and that though they are both alike, <hi>frail ſinful Mortals,</hi> much more then ought we to be <hi>ſubject,</hi> and bear the profoundeſt <hi>Reverence</hi> to <hi>Chriſt our Saviour,</hi>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:103289:100"/>who is the <hi>King of Glory, the Son of God, who upholds all things by the Word of his Power and ſits on the right Hand of the Majeſty on high;</hi> whom all the Angels of God worſhip, and who beſides, is moſt <hi>tender</hi> and <hi>affectionate</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> and his Government directed by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As a Wife ought not only to be ſubject to the Diſpoſals of her Husband, and <hi>paſſively</hi> obedient, but likewiſe <hi>actively</hi> ſo, and ready chearfully to <hi>obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;</hi> ſo ought every <hi>Believer</hi> to be to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, <hi>this</hi> is the main Tryal of <hi>true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal</hi> Affection, and is the beſt Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of all other Shews of Love and Fidelity, and Reverence and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. For where <hi>true</hi> Love, Reverence and Submiſſion is, a <hi>chearful Obedience</hi> will ſurely follow; and on the contrary, where there is no willing <hi>chearful Obedience,</hi> there is but very <hi>little,</hi> if <hi>any</hi> ſincere <hi>Affection.</hi> And therefore, ſays our dear Lord, <hi>if ye love me keep my Commandments: And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I ſay?</hi> And of <hi>Sarah</hi> 'tis ſaid, ſhe <hi>obey'd Abraham</hi> as well as call'd him <hi>Lord.</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> agreeably, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.5. <hi>whoſo keepeth his Word, in him verily is the Love of God perfected; and hereby know we that we are in him.</hi> And therefore, <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Commands</hi> of this our glorious Husband, is above all things neceſſary to continue that our near Relation to him; <hi>and his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not grievous,</hi> but <hi>his Yoke is eaſie
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103289:100"/>and his Burthen light:</hi> And 'twould be <hi>ſtrange</hi> if we ſhould not obey <hi>him,</hi> who commands us nothing but what is in its own <hi>Nature</hi> neceſſary in order to our Happineſs in both Worlds.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>laſt</hi> place, the Goſpel is productive of like <hi>Effects</hi> to thoſe of Marriage, and from this ſo <hi>near</hi> Relation of Believers to Chriſt proceeds the Increaſe of ſuch as ſhall be the <hi>Children</hi> of God, a numerous Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to inherit the Kingdom of Heaven, and fill up the Vacancies left by the Fall of the rebellious Angels.</p>
            <p>Thus our Lord calls the becoming <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>'s a being <hi>born again, John</hi> 3.3. and teaches us when we pray to <hi>God</hi> to ſay <hi>Our Father.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> agreeably, in a Quotation from the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> ſays, as in the Perſon of God, <hi>I will be a Father unto you, and ye ſhall be my Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſaith the Lord Allmighty.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.18.</note> And the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> which is from above, or the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, is ſaid to be <hi>the Mother of us all, Gal.</hi> 4.26. and Chap. 3.26. <hi>we are all the Children of God by Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And if Children then <hi>Heirs, Heirs of God and joynt Heirs with Chriſt,</hi> of that glorious Kingdom of his which is not of <hi>this</hi> World, but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the Heavens. <hi>Well</hi> therefore may we cry out with Admiration, as St. <hi>John</hi> does,
<note place="margin">1 John 3.1.</note> 
               <hi>Behold what manner of Love the Father hath beſtow'd upon us that we ſhould be call'd the Sons of God! And every Man that hath this Hope in him,</hi> of being receiv'd into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103289:101"/>of his heavenly Father, and <hi>ſeeing him as he is; muſt purifie himſelf even as he is pure:</hi> And having ſuch glorious Expectations, <hi>cleanſe himſelf from all Filthyneſs, both of Fleſh and Spirit, perfecting Holyneſs in the Fear of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> then is the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> 'tis as a <hi>Marriage</hi> between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Believers. There is one thing more to be conſider'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this <hi>firſt</hi> General, namely, who they are that are admitted to the Joys and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of this bleſſed Condition? They are deſcrib'd in the Parable by the <hi>poor</hi> and the <hi>maim'd,</hi> the <hi>halt</hi> and the <hi>blind.</hi> And truly, juſt ſuch was Man's Condition, before God was pleaſed to call him to this <hi>happy Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</hi> Deſpicably <hi>poor</hi> we were, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of any real Excellency that could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend us to the Favour of God; our Souls were like a parch'd and barren Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, burnt up with vile Luſts and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, no Fruits of Holineſs appearing, but drawing ſtill nearer and nearer to everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Perdition. <hi>Maim'd</hi> we were in all our Faculties by our frequent deſperate Falls from our Obedience to God, and full of <hi>Wounds and Bruiſes and putrifying Sores;</hi> and our beſt Performances very <hi>lame</hi> and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, like the <hi>Haltings</hi> of a Cripple; and our <hi>Underſtandings</hi> withall <hi>blinded</hi> by the Deceitfulneſs of Sin, which put out that Candle of the Lord, and made it uncapable of directing us in the right Way that leads to Happineſs, ſo that we lay groping in the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103289:101"/>
               <hi>Dark,</hi> ſurrounded with <hi>Terrors,</hi> rack'd by <hi>Uncertainties,</hi> miſerably poor and indigent, and utterly unable to help our ſelves. When lo! There aroſe up a <hi>Light</hi> in this Darkneſs, and through the infinite Mercy of our God the <hi>Day-ſpring from on high</hi> did viſit us, we were pitied and commiſerated by the Father of Mercies, and in this forlorn Condition, call'd to partake of the ineffable Joys and Felicities that attend the neareſt and deareſt Relation to the <hi>Son of God. The Lord anointed him to preach the Goſpel to the poor; he ſent him to heal the broken-hearted, to preach Deliverance to the captives, and Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Sight to the blind, and to ſet at Liberty them that are bruiſed, Luke</hi> 4.18. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, he <hi>inrich'd</hi> our Poverty, <hi>reſtor'd</hi> our Sight, <hi>heal'd</hi> our Bruiſes, and <hi>confirm'd</hi> our Strength, <hi>and of his Fulneſs have we all receiv'd;</hi> and nothing for the Future can ever make us miſerable but <hi>our ſelves</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, as we ſhould adore and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, with all our Souls, the wondrous Goodneſs and Compaſſion of God and our Saviour, in receiving ſuch wretched <hi>polluted</hi> Creatures as we were by Nature, into ſo <hi>intimate</hi> a Relation to himſelf, and making us Partakers of the Comforts of his bleſſed Spirit in this World, and providing Crowns of Glory for us in the next: So above all things ſhould we dread to fall back into the ſame Condition again, <hi>and work out our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with Fear and Trembling.</hi> For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, 't would have been better for us never
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103289:102"/>to have taſted of the divine Compaſſion in ſo extraordinary a Manner as we have done, and our latter End will be worſe than our Beginning.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the firſt thing to be conſider'd in this Parable, namely, the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> or Chriſtian Religion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the <hi>Marriage of a King's Son,</hi> and the <hi>poor</hi> and the <hi>maim'd,</hi> the <hi>halt</hi> and the <hi>blind</hi> being call'd in to partake of the Joys and Feſtivities of that great Solemnity. I proceed now to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> thing to be conſider'd, namely, God's great Care in having this Goſpel <hi>preach'd,</hi> this Religion publiſh'd and <hi>made known</hi> to all Men, and his repeated <hi>Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to all Men to <hi>embrace</hi> it; repreſented by that King's <hi>ſending forth his Servants to call thoſe that were bidden to the Wedding, and again ſending other Servants,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to tell thoſe that were bidden, <hi>that he had prepar'd and made all things ready,</hi> and therefore to <hi>urge them to come unto the Marriage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How great God's Care has been that this Goſpel ſhould be <hi>publiſh'd,</hi> and how <hi>repeated</hi> his Invitations to Men have been, that they would embrace it; is evident from the whole Story of the <hi>firſt</hi> planting of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and from the Courſe, that by God's Appointment, has been taken <hi>ever ſince.</hi> At <hi>firſt,</hi> many were endow'd with very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Abilities for this Purpoſe, ſuch as the Gift of <hi>Tongues,</hi> whereby they were
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103289:102"/>enabled wherever they ſhould go, to preach the Goſpel to Men in their own native Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; and a Power of working Miracles to confirm the <hi>Truth</hi> of their Doctrin; and with this Meſſage and theſe ſupernatural Abilities, were they ſent to the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Corners of the Earth; even our <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> as little <hi>known,</hi> and as <hi>barbarous</hi> as <hi>then</hi> it was, receiv'd, and that very <hi>early,</hi> the glad Tidings of the Goſpel. And for a Supply of the <hi>Cortality</hi> of the firſt Teachers of this holy Religion, that no Age might want thoſe that ſhould inſtruct Men in, and invite them to it, there was an Order of Men ſet apart on purpoſe for this great Work, and empower'd to ordain others that ſhould tread in their Steps when they were gone, and thoſe likewiſe <hi>others,</hi> and ſo down ſucceſſively till Time ſhall be no more; and as ſo many Ambaſſadors from the great King of Heaven to perſwade Men to hearken to the Propoſals of Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made to them through the Merits and Interceſſion of his Son, and to partake of the infinite <hi>Happineſs</hi> that will follow upon that bleſſed <hi>Agreement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, like the King's Servants in the Parable, are to let Men know, what <hi>Bliſs</hi> will be the Reſult of their coming to this ſpiritual Marriage, and entring into ſo near a Relation to the eternal Son of God; that all things are ready to compleat that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Solemnity, the Feaſt prepar'd, the Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and Fatlings kill'd, <hi>i.e.</hi> Heaven and the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103289:103"/>ineffable Pleaſures of it ready to receive thoſe that ſhall ſincerely enter into this near Relation to Chriſt, and continue always faithful in it; and in the mean time the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Joys of a good Conſcience, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raviſhing Expectation of the Time when thoſe Felicities ſhall be enjoy'd, ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably cheer and refreſh the Soul, and be as ſo many <hi>Antepaſts of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is like the Courſe that the Lord took with the obſtinate Jews, mention'd <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.4. <hi>He ſent unto them all his Servants, the Prophets riſing early and ſending them,</hi> they cry'd, <hi>Turn ye again now every one from his evil Way, and from the Evil of your Doings, and dwell in the Land that the Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to you, and to your Fathers for ever; for why will ye dye O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael! Many the like pathetick Expreſſions there are in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of God's great Deſire of the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mankind, and as earneſt <hi>Intreaties</hi> that we would accept of thoſe ineſtimable Favours he would confer upon us, if <hi>we</hi> were to <hi>confer</hi> the Favours, and <hi>he</hi> to receive them.</p>
            <p>Now, when we conſider the infinite Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>us,</hi> what <hi>deſpicable</hi> Creatures comparatively the beſt of us are, <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>maim'd, halt</hi> and <hi>blind,</hi> as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable expreſſes it; how infinitely <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> the <hi>divine Nature</hi> is, and would for <hi>ever</hi> be, though the whole Creation were <hi>annihilated;</hi> ſo that <hi>our</hi> Righteouſneſs will not reach to <hi>him</hi> to make any <hi>Addition</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:103289:103"/>to <hi>his Felicity,</hi> nor will it be in the leaſt <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to him that we make our Way perfect;</hi> and if we conſider likewiſe our great <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions</hi> againſt him, <hi>obſtinately</hi> perſiſted in even until <hi>now,</hi> the little <hi>Deſire</hi> we have of his Favour, the many Slights that we have made of his Overtures of Peace and the like: We ſhall ſoon perceive, that his <hi>Mercy</hi> is indeed <hi>over all his Works,</hi> and that his Compaſſions fail not as long as there is any Hopes of our complying with his gracious Intentions for our Happineſs. And ſuch <hi>ſtupendious</hi> Goodneſs as this, to Creatures in our vile Circumſtances, can never be enough ador'd and magnifyed. Only let us remember, that the greater the Expreſſions are of God's <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> to Sinners, the greater will be his <hi>Anger,</hi> the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere his <hi>Vengeance</hi> to ſuch as finally <hi>reject</hi> it, and obſtinately <hi>perſiſt</hi> in their Rebellion againſt him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> thing expreſs'd in this Parable, is what Kind of <hi>Reception</hi> the Goſpel and the Teachers of it are like to meet with in the World, repreſented by Men's making <hi>light</hi> of the King's Invitation to the Marriage of his Son, and offering frivolous <hi>Excuſes,</hi> ſuch as <hi>of having bought a Piece of Ground, and a Yoke of Oxen,</hi> and <hi>of having married a Wife,</hi> and that theſe things would engage 'em ſo that they could not come; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly going their Way, <hi>one to his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, another to his Farm,</hi> and the reſt taking thoſe Servants that came to invite
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103289:104"/>them, and <hi>intreating them deſpightfully and ſlaying them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In general, <hi>ſlighting</hi> and <hi>undervaluing</hi> the glad Tidings of the <hi>Goſpel, was,</hi> and <hi>is ſtill</hi> and is too like <hi>to be</hi> the <hi>Reception</hi> of it; Men's Luſts and vile Affections diſſuading them from embracing ſo <hi>holy</hi> a Religion, and the <hi>Evil of their Deeds</hi> making them <hi>love Darkneſs rather than</hi> this glorious <hi>Light,</hi> which will <hi>diſcover</hi> and <hi>reprove</hi> them. And Men having ſo little Reliſh for the <hi>Religion,</hi> have as little <hi>Reſpect</hi> for thoſe that <hi>preach</hi> and <hi>enforce</hi> it, and endeavour to <hi>ſilence</hi> and <hi>diſcourage</hi> them by their malicious ill Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them; like thoſe in the Parable, who took the King's Servants and entreated them ſpitefully and ſlew them. And, as in this Caſe it ſeems very ſtrange, that thoſe who came upon ſo <hi>friendly</hi> an Errand as to invite to the Pleaſures and Feſtivities of ſo great a Marriage as that of a King's Son, ſhould be treated ſo inhumanely in Return; ſo methinks, 'tis as ſtrange, that thoſe whom God has ſent to invite Men to their <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and to prepare them for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of himſelf in Glory, ſhould be us'd like ſo many <hi>Enemies,</hi> and deſpis'd as the <hi>Peſts</hi> of Society, and the <hi>Offscouring of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>ſo</hi> it is too generally, and the Reaſon muſt be this, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>we are therefore look'd upon as Men's Enemies becauſe we tell them the Truth.</hi> Becauſe we tell 'em they muſt <hi>love God above all things,</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:103289:104"/>and not be too <hi>fond</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and deny and mortifie the unruly Paſſions and Deſires of the Body, and lead this preſent Life in <hi>Sobriety, Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> if they hope to partake of the Joys of Heaven; therefore we are <hi>the Troublers of</hi> Iſrael, as King <hi>Ahab</hi> ſaid to <hi>Elijah,</hi> and as ſuch, made the Object of Men's <hi>Scorn</hi> and <hi>Hate.</hi> But, as our Lord takes all the <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Reſpect which his Miniſters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as done unto <hi>himſelf</hi> (the Treatment of an Ambaſſador being look'd upon as the Treatment of the Prince that ſends him, <hi>and we are the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt</hi>) ſo on the contrary, he that ſhall treat <hi>deſpightfully</hi> the <hi>leaſt</hi> of theſe his Servants, <hi>'twere better for him that a Milſtone were hang'd about his Neck, and he caſt into the Midſt of the Sea.</hi> But of this ſomething more in the Sequel.</p>
            <p>Let us now conſider the <hi>Excuſes</hi> thoſe in the Parable made for their not going to the Marriage of the King's Son (and which are offer'd <hi>ſtill</hi> by irreligious Men) and the great <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and Invalidity of them.</p>
            <p>The firſt two, of having bought a Piece of Ground, and a Yoke of Oxen, and going to ſee the one and prove the other are much the <hi>ſame,</hi> and ſo ſhall be conſider'd together, and they both amount to thus much, that they preferr'd the minding their own <hi>petty</hi> Affairs (and which might have been as well let alone till another Time) before that great Honour the King did them in inviting them to the <hi>Marriage of his Son:</hi> And they
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103289:105"/>might well believe ſuch Excuſes would ſerve to no other Purpoſe but to provoke the King to <hi>Anger,</hi> when he ſhould ſee his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour made thus light of, and Men's common Buſineſs preferr'd before it.</p>
            <p>In like manner, too many <hi>now-adays</hi> are ſo weak as to plead <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> and the Affairs of the World, in excuſe of their great Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the things of <hi>Religion:</hi> Our Callings muſt be follow'd, Buſineſs muſt be done, our Families muſt be maintain'd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be expected that we can be <hi>much</hi> at <hi>Leiſure</hi> for <hi>Religion</hi> at the <hi>preſent;</hi> when the Fatigues of <hi>this</hi> World begin to be <hi>over,</hi> and we draw near the <hi>other, then</hi> we'll give our ſelves up to the making <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion</hi> for it. And this, though few Men will <hi>ſpeak it out,</hi> is the Senſe of too many as is evident from their <hi>Practice;</hi> and truly ſome make no Scruple to declare this <hi>openly.</hi> Now, though it be very true that Buſineſs muſt be minded, and our Families maintain'd, and <hi>Induſtry</hi> is as much a Chriſtian Duty as any other, and is it ſelf a Part of Piety; yet it is but a <hi>Part,</hi> and will not commute for a Neglect of all the reſt; nay, this <hi>Sort</hi> of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry we are ſpeaking of, is one of the <hi>leaſt</hi> Parts of Piety, and provided the <hi>Neceſſaries</hi> of Life are ſecur'd, 'tis not only <hi>lawful,</hi> but very <hi>commendable</hi> to abate of our Induſtry in the Perſuit of <hi>this</hi> World's Good, and lay it out upon the greater Concerns of the <hi>next.</hi> Thus when Jeſus came to the Houſe of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Martha,</hi> out of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103289:105"/>Zeal to entertain him well, was buſied in making ready Proviſions for him, while <hi>Mary</hi> ſet at his Feet liſtning to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtructions; when <hi>Martha</hi> complain'd to him that her Siſter had left all the Trouble to her, and deſir'd him to order that ſhe ſhould help her: Jeſus anſwer'd and ſaid unto her, Martha, Martha, <hi>thou art careful and troubled about many things, but one thing is</hi> above all <hi>needful, and Mary hath choſen that good Part which ſhall not be taken from her,</hi> Luk. 10.40. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And accordingly, in his divine Sermon on the Mount, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.24, 25. <hi>ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon,</hi> ſays our Lord; <hi>therefore take no Thought, i.e.</hi> no anxious, over eager Concern, <hi>for your Life, what ye ſhall eat or drink, or wherewith be cloathed,</hi> but Verſ. 33. <hi>ſeek ye firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you, for your heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth that ye have need of all theſe things.</hi> Seek ye <hi>firſt</hi> the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs, let it be your <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> Care and Endeavour to be rich <hi>towards God,</hi> and abound in <hi>good Works,</hi> and then a <hi>moderate</hi> Care for the things of <hi>this</hi> Life, will, with God's Bleſſing, which alone can give Proſperity, be ſufficient. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to do as is too commonly done in the World, and firſt provide, with great Care and Induſtry, for Abundance <hi>here,</hi> and then at laſt think a little of the <hi>Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs,</hi> is ſuch an ungodly and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103289:106"/>unreaſonable Courſe, as can never end in any thing but bitter Remorſe at laſt, and utter Confuſion; ſo vain and frivolous is this firſt Excuſe Men offer for their not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Religion ſo affectionately as they ſhould do, namely, that they have bought Farms and Oxen and muſt look after <hi>them, i. e.</hi> are deeply engag'd in the Affairs and Buſineſs of <hi>this Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Excuſe offer'd in the Parable for abſenting from the Marriage of the King's Son, was the having <hi>married a Wife;</hi> the Man was ſo taken up with the Pleaſures of his <hi>own</hi> new Condition, that he had no Appetite for thoſe at the King's Son's Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>And <hi>this,</hi> as little of Validity as it has in it, is in Effect very often pleaded by Men, againſt their medling with <hi>Religion</hi> at leaſt at <hi>preſent.</hi> They are <hi>young</hi> they ſay, and in the Age of Pleaſure and Jollity; the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>World</hi> are very <hi>ſweet</hi> to 'em, and Religion is too <hi>auſtere</hi> for them as <hi>yet;</hi> what <hi>Pleaſures</hi> are ſaid to be in it are of a Nature <hi>contrary</hi> to their <hi>Propenſions</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; and therefore they deſire to be excus'd if they don't leave theſe preſent Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions but enjoy them while they can, and <hi>afterwards</hi> 'tis likely they may advert to the Pleaſures of <hi>Religion,</hi> which, though they have heard ſo much <hi>Talk</hi> of, they can't frame any ſo lovely Idea of them, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them to leave what by <hi>Experience</hi> they find ſo grateful to them. And this, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103289:106"/>the <hi>Practice</hi> of moſt younger Perſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes, but many are ſo forſaken of Reaſon as to <hi>own</hi> it <hi>plainly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, ſince they talk of <hi>Experience,</hi> I dare appeal even to <hi>themſelves,</hi> whether they have not met with more <hi>Diſappointment</hi> than <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> from the greateſt ſenſual Pleaſures they have enjoy'd? The thing is too <hi>notorious</hi> to be <hi>deny'd;</hi> and they <hi>tacitly</hi> confeſs it by <hi>ſhifting</hi> Pleaſures ſo often as they do, for where there is <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> what need of <hi>Change?</hi> And I may likewiſe <hi>boldly</hi> aſſert <hi>this,</hi> from the Experience of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many that have taſted both Sorts of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, thoſe of the <hi>World</hi> as well as of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> that there is no Compariſon between the one and the other, and that the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that flowes from a <hi>ſincere Religion,</hi> is infinitely to be preferr'd before the moſt <hi>ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died.</hi> Gratifications of Senſe; nay, even thoſe Pleaſures of Senſe reliſh much better for being ſeaſon'd with Religion: So that to neglect <hi>Religion</hi> out of a Fondneſs for <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> is as if a Man ſhould run from a <hi>Fountain</hi> becauſe he is parch'd with <hi>Thirſt.</hi> No Pleaſures certainly like thoſe of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and he that once drinks of thoſe Rivers of Delight that flow from <hi>her,</hi> will never thirſt again after the tainted Puddles of <hi>bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> Enjoyments, for <hi>her</hi> Ways only are Ways of ſincere and <hi>unmix'd</hi> Pleaſure, and <hi>all</hi> her Paths are <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing the Pleaſures of this World to be <hi>indeed</hi> as great, as ſome Men, after all
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103289:107"/>their <hi>Baulks</hi> and <hi>Diſappointments,</hi> will ſtill <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> them to be; and that Religion is an <hi>auſtere</hi> and <hi>rugged</hi> thing, and but little or no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Satisfaction to be met with in the Practice of it; yet, ſince the Pleaſures of the <hi>World,</hi> how <hi>great</hi> ſoever, are very ſhort and momentary, and muſt certainly <hi>die with</hi> us, and generally leave us long <hi>before</hi> we die; and ſince <hi>Religion,</hi> how unpleaſant ſoever here, will ſecure to us the Enjoyment of unconceivable Pleaſures that are for ever in the Preſence of God: No rational Man but will think it a very childiſh Excuſe for the Neglect of <hi>Religion</hi> to plead our Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Gaieties and Enjoyments of <hi>this</hi> World. 'Tis like a Child's ſlighting a Wedge of Gold, and rather perſuing an <hi>empty</hi> Bubble becauſe it ſhines and <hi>glitters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So utterly without Excuſe are thoſe who deſpiſe and reject the Offers of the Goſpel and the Invitations to <hi>Religion,</hi> upon Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Riches and Pleaſures of the <hi>World;</hi> or indeed upon any other Account whatever: For, Religion is our <hi>cheif</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and therefore nothing can ſtand in Competition with it. Thoſe that <hi>put by</hi> the Thoughts of it till a more <hi>convenient</hi> Time, that is, till they are fit for nothing elſe, are no doubt very highly diſpleaſing to the great Author of it; but thoſe are much <hi>more</hi> ſo, who totally and <hi>inſultingly reject</hi> it. To <hi>defer</hi> the great Buſineſs of Religion is a very heinous Provocation; but atheiſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103289:107"/>to <hi>oppoſe</hi> and vilifie it is certainly much worſe. Which leads me to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth</hi> thing expreſs'd in this Parable, namely, the Sadneſs of their Condition, who, when they have <hi>heard</hi> of, either total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>reject</hi> this holy Religion, and abuſe thoſe that invite them to embrace it; or elſe, though they <hi>profeſs</hi> it, are negligent of its <hi>Duties,</hi> and live not <hi>agreeably</hi> to it. The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe is repreſented by the King's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Wroth</hi> with thoſe that made <hi>light</hi> of and complyed not with his Invitation to the Marriage of his Son, and pronouncing them <hi>unworthy</hi> of that <hi>Favour,</hi> and that they ſhould <hi>not taſte of his Supper,</hi> and ſending his Servants to invite <hi>others</hi> to the Wedding; and commanding his Armies to go and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy</hi> thoſe Murderers, that had <hi>ſpitefully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated and ſlain his Servants,</hi> who brought the gracious Invitation to them, and to <hi>burn up their City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, well may God's Wrath be kindled againſt thoſe that reject theſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous Expreſſions of his Love, and trample under Foot the Son of God, and deſpiſe and vilifie his holy Religion, and undervalue all his Condeſcentions, and uſe his Ambaſſadors deſpitefully, and call the whole a <hi>Trick,</hi> a State Juggle, and glory in their Infidelity, and too often <hi>blaſpheme</hi> that bleſſed Jeſus, by whom alone cometh Salvation.</p>
            <p>Theſe Men will do well to conſider, that if it ſhould prove <hi>true,</hi> that there is no other Name by which we can be ſav'd but that of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:103289:108"/>
               <hi>Jeſus, their</hi> Caſe will be infinitely miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble who have <hi>not believ'd</hi> in that Name, but made it their Buſineſs to prophane and <hi>ridicule</hi> it as much as was poſſible; but ſhould it prove <hi>not true,</hi> their Belief in it will not at all be <hi>injurious</hi> to them either in <hi>this</hi> world or in the <hi>next</hi> ſhould there be any after this. And therefore, ſince the witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Infidel in the World cannot prove but that 'tis <hi>poſſible,</hi> and <hi>may</hi> be <hi>true,</hi> that Jeſus is the only Saviour of the World, and the Conſequence of <hi>not</hi> believing in him, being ſo ſad ſhould it at length prove indeed to <hi>be true;</hi> certainly it muſt be the moſt <hi>prudent</hi> Courſe to be of the <hi>ſureſt</hi> Side, and embrace that Faith, which if <hi>true,</hi> is the only Way to Happineſs; and if <hi>falſe,</hi> will not however <hi>leave</hi> a Man in any Reſpect in a worſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than it found him.</p>
            <p>How <hi>ſad</hi> the <hi>Conſequence</hi> will be of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Jeſus as the only Saviour of the World, and of rejecting the Religion he taught, is expreſs'd in this Parable by the King's pronouncing thoſe that would not come to the Marriage of his Son, to be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy</hi> of that Favour, and reſolving that they <hi>ſhould not taſte of his Supper,</hi> and ſending his Servants to invite <hi>others</hi> to the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: Which was <hi>literally</hi> verifyed upon the <hi>obſtinate Jews,</hi> and will be as <hi>effectually</hi> upon all <hi>other Infidels.</hi> That is, Men's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Infidelity ſhall at length be repay'd with God's <hi>withdrawing</hi> that Favour which he ſo long <hi>tender'd</hi> them and they <hi>refus'd,</hi>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:103289:108"/>and putting an End to their Day of Grace and Salvation, and <hi>ſealing</hi> 'em up (as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimable) to Deſtruction. <hi>Becauſe I have called and ye refuſed</hi> (ſays <hi>Solomon,</hi> perſonat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Chriſt</hi> or the Divine Wiſdom) <hi>I have ſtretch'd out my Hand and no Man regarded, but ye have ſet at nought my Counſel, and would have none of my Reproof; I alſo will laugh at your Calamity and mock when your Fear cometh; when your Fear cometh as Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and your Deſtruction as a Whirlwind; when Diſtreſs and Anguiſh cometh upon you, then ſhall they call upon me but I will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, they ſhall ſeek me early but they ſhall not find me,</hi> Prov. 1.24. <hi>The things that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Peace,</hi> which <hi>once</hi> were tender'd and made known to them, <hi>ſhall then be hid from their Eyes.</hi> And no Condition can be ſo miſerable as theirs, who by obſtinate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, put themſelves out of all <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of Salvation.</p>
            <p>The ſad Conſequence of uſing thoſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Perſons contumeliouſly and deſpitefully who come as <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> from God with theſe glad Tidings of Salvation, is expreſs'd in the Parable, by the King's <hi>ſending forth his Armies to deſtroy thoſe Murderers and to burn up their City;</hi> which was likewiſe <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> fufilll'd in the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſhall be as effectually verify'd upon thoſe wicked Men who vent their <hi>Spleen</hi> againſt the <hi>Religion</hi> upon thoſe that <hi>preach</hi> it, and vilifie and abuſe and trample upon the one becauſe they hate the other. But Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:103289:109"/>is mine, I will repay, ſaith the Lord; and a fiery Deſtruction, even that of Hell, ſhall (without a deep Repentance, which we beſeech God to grant them) be the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe whoſe Malice was ſo invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate againſt Men ſent from God to invite them to <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Caſe of ſuch, as when they have heard, totally <hi>reject</hi> this holy Religion, and <hi>abuſe</hi> and vilifie thoſe that perſwade them to embrace it. And theirs is as bad, who, though they <hi>profeſs</hi> it, are negligent of its <hi>Duties,</hi> and live not <hi>agreeably</hi> to it: Which is expreſs'd in the Parable by a King's finding <hi>a Man at the Marriage Supper that had not on a Wedding Garment, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him, Friend, how cameſt thou in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not having on a Wedding Garment?</hi> And the Man's being <hi>ſpeechleſs</hi> upon it, and the King's commanding his Servants <hi>to bind him Hand and Foot and take him away and caſt him into outer Darkneſs, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is in Alluſion to what was cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in thoſe Eaſtern Countries, the having peculiar <hi>florid</hi> Sort of Garments, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to grace ſuch feſtival Solemnities, and none being permitted to taſte of thoſe Feaſts, but who had ſuch Garments on.</p>
            <p>So in <hi>Chriſtianity, Repentance</hi> and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Life are the <hi>Wedding Garment,</hi> without which <hi>none,</hi> let them make never ſo ſpecious <hi>Profeſſions,</hi> ſhall taſte of that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which is propos'd as the Reward of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:103289:109"/>believing in Jeſus. <hi>Faith</hi> without <hi>Works</hi> is <hi>dead;</hi> the Soul without <hi>Repentance</hi> is <hi>pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted,</hi> whatever it profeſſes to <hi>believe;</hi> and without real and ſubſtantial <hi>Holineſs</hi> no Man ſhall <hi>ſee the Lord.</hi> And when at the great Scrutiny in the laſt Day, God ſhall take a <hi>View</hi> of every Man, of the State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Soul, that every Man may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed of according to his Deſerts; and ſhall ask thoſe formal <hi>Profeſſors</hi> who have liv'd like <hi>Heathens,</hi> or as if <hi>Faith alone</hi> could ſave them, and took no Care of good Works, How came <hi>you</hi> in hither? How came <hi>you</hi> into this Society of Chriſtians not having on the Wedding Garment? What will they be able to ſay in their Excuſe? Will they not be like him in the Parable, confounded and aſhamed, and utterly <hi>ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs!</hi> What will they have to plead in Bar of that dire Sentence which will then be paſt upon them, <hi>bind them Hand and Foot and take them away,</hi> &amp;c. certainly <hi>nothing,</hi> but with inexpreſſible Horror and Deſpair and <hi>Self-Condemnation</hi> muſt ſubmit to their ſad Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>From all this, there is in the <hi>laſt</hi> Place this general <hi>Obſervation</hi> drawn, that <hi>many are call'd, but few choſen.</hi> The plain Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, I ſuppoſe, to be this.</p>
            <p>That though the Goſpel is preach'd to Myriads of People, and all that hear of it are <hi>invited</hi> alike to <hi>embrace</hi> it, and 'tis God's good Pleaſure that <hi>all</hi> ſhould <hi>be ſav'd, and come to the Knowledg of the Truth:</hi> Yet the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103289:110"/>
               <hi>moſt</hi> will make a very ill Uſe of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Choice; and <hi>many</hi> utterly <hi>reject</hi> this Invitation; and more, though they do <hi>embrace</hi> it, yet become never the <hi>better</hi> for it, by not leading their Lives agreeably to their holy Profeſſion. And by this means, among the <hi>many</hi> that are <hi>call'd,</hi> there will be but <hi>few</hi> that will approve themſelves to God as <hi>elect</hi> or <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>right good</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and but <hi>few</hi> conſequently, that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the eternal Joy of their Lord; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what our Lord ſaid in another Place, <hi>ſtrait is the Gate and narrow is the Way that leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, to conclude this Parable. As we have all of us been <hi>call'd</hi> and <hi>invited</hi> to a ſincere Faith in, and intire Obedience to the holy Jeſus, and do make open <hi>Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of ſuch <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Shew</hi> of ſuch <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> it concerns us as much as our Souls are worth, and as we would avoid that <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Darkneſs</hi> where is eternal <hi>weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth;</hi> to take all poſſible Care that our Faith be ſo <hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>lively</hi> as to produce <hi>good Works,</hi> ſuch as may <hi>make our Calling and Election ſure.</hi> Not to reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the <hi>Form</hi> of Godlineſs, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of Chriſtianity, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after the <hi>Power</hi> of it and lead our Lives according to our Belief; to imitate our Lord's moſt bleſſed Example, and obey all his holy Precepts, and ſubmit to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſals of his Providence chearfully, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103289:110"/>bear unſpotted Love and Fidelity to him through the whole Courſe of our Lives. And by this means ſhall we be reckon'd among his <hi>choice Jewels, elect and precious,</hi> and be receiv'd into the <hi>neareſt</hi> and <hi>deareſt,</hi> and even an <hi>inſeparable</hi> Relation to him; and when this Life's at an End, be condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by his Angels into his <hi>glorious Preſence,</hi> there to ſhare in his <hi>Happineſs</hi> to eternal Ages:</p>

               <p>MOST bleſſed God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who in infinite Mercy, and amazing Condeſcenſion haſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me miſerable Creature (though poor and maim'd, halt and blind, and deſtitute of every thing that may recommend me to thee, except it be my Wretchedneſs) to the moſt intimate Union with thy glorious Son; and as the Bride of that divine Bridegroom to enjoy his Love, and be bleſſed with his tendereſt Regard, his Protection and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and to partake of his Honour and Glory and Happineſs: How can I enough praiſe and magnifie this thy wondrous Goodneſs!

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:103289:111"/>and diſregarded this gracious Offer, and preferr'd every thing before this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Marriage with the Son of God; or at beſt have deferr'd it ſtill till another Time, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking thereby moſt juſtly thy Wrath and Indignation againſt me, and deſerving to be for ever excluded thy bleſſed Preſence as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely unworthy.

And grant, O merciful God, I humbly intreat thee, that the Spirit of Infidelity may never poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs my Soul, leſt I totally reject this bleſſed Invitation, or having embrac'd it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into ſo near a Relation to my Saviour, again divorce my ſelf from him by entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrange and forbidden Loves. And ſince I am ſo highly honour'd by the Son of God, O may I always be careful to preſerve the

                  <p>Then ſhall the Kingdom of Heaven be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto Ten Virgins, which took their Lamps, and went forth to meet the Bridegroom.</p>

            <p>THough the <hi>firſt</hi> Intention of this Parable, as may be probably col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (which is a Deſcription of the ſad State that was e'er long to overtake <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> for the Jews obſtinate Infidelity, and their murdering their Saviour) was to urge the Jewiſh Chriſtians to a Preparation and watchful Care againſt that Time of Sorrows; and that they would be ſo wiſe as to make Proviſion for their <hi>Safety</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very careful that that Time ſurprize

            <p>By the <hi>Lamps</hi> of thoſe Virgins, is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Souls</hi> of Chriſtians, which are to burn with holy Fires of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> to

               <hi>God</hi> and their <hi>Saviour,</hi> and make them as ſo many <hi>Lights</hi> in this <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>benighted</hi> World; for ye are the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> ſays our Lord to his Diſciples, therefore <hi>let your Light ſo ſhine before Men that they may ſee your good Works and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5.14, 16. That is, as the Souls of Chriſtians are <hi>illuminated</hi> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of him who is the <hi>Father of Lights,</hi> and in whom is no Darkneſs at all; as they are <hi>warm'd</hi> by his Influences who deſcended upon the Apoſtles in the Likeneſs of <hi>Fire,</hi> and have <hi>divine Affections,</hi> by his holy Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings inkindled in them; ſo they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the <hi>whole Man,</hi> and make thoſe that name the Name of Chriſt like ſo many burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhining Lights in the Midſt of a crooked and perverſe Generation, ſo many <hi>eminent</hi> Examples of Piety and <hi>real</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>ſuch,</hi> as by theis own <hi>Practice</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend their moſt hloy Religion, and ſet before Men's Eyes the <hi>Beauty of Holineſs</hi> by their own <hi>Converſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> whom theſe <hi>Virgins</hi> with their <hi>Lamps</hi> went forth to meet, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented our dear <hi>Saviour,</hi> that heavenly King's divine Son, for whom he made ſo glorious a Marriage in the Parable I laſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcours'd of; where the Reaſons why the Goſpel is compar'd to a Marriage and our Lord to a Bridegroom are particularly inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted on. And by going forth to <hi>meet</hi> this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Bridegroom is ſignifyed our <hi>preparing</hi> againſt his calling us from this World by
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103289:116"/>
               <hi>Death,</hi> and providing againſt his Advent to <hi>Judgment;</hi> that is, by frequently contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating our <hi>Mortality,</hi> reflecting on the <hi>Shortneſs</hi> and <hi>Uncertainty</hi> of Life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore making the beſt Uſe of our Time while we have it, as not knowing how ſoon our Breath may be required of us; and becauſe after Death comes <hi>Judgment,</hi> therefore endeavouring to make <hi>ready</hi> our Accounts by frequent Self-Examination, and from the ſerious Conſideration of the <hi>Terrors</hi> of that great Day, and the ſevere Scrutiny into our <hi>Thoughts</hi> as well as Words and Actions that we muſt then undergo, colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting with S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.11.</note> 
               <hi>what manner of Perſons we ought to be in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs, that we may be found of the great Judg in Peace,</hi> and, as <hi>Virgins, without Spot and blameleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the <hi>Oyl</hi> in the Virgins Lamps, and which they took with them in their Veſſels when they went to meet the Bridegroom, is repreſented the <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, which are the proper <hi>Nouriſhment</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> (that <hi>Lamp of the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> calls it) and will brighten and enliven it as Plenty of Oyl does a Lamp, and make <hi>the Way of the Juſt like a ſhining Light, ſhining more and more unto the perfect Day;</hi> and which, when they fail, ſpiritual <hi>Darkneſs</hi> will follow as in a Lamp <hi>gone out: And if the Light that is in you be Darkneſs, ſays our Lord, how great is that Darkneſs!</hi> But the Chriſtian Vertues were very aptly repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Oyl</hi> upon theſe further Accounts.</p>
            <pb n="211" facs="tcp:103289:116"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe <hi>Oyl</hi> was generally reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in the eaſtern Countries as a great Part of a Man's <hi>Riches;</hi> and when they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs great <hi>Wealth,</hi> they do it by magnifying the Plenty of <hi>Oyl.</hi> Thus <hi>Job,</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, in his Affliction, upon his former opulent Condition, the Rock (or the ſtone Jar that was made uſe of to preſerve Oyl in) ſays he, pour'd me out <hi>Rivers of Oyl,</hi> Job 29.6. And the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the Impoſſibility of appeaſing his offended God, even by the moſt <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>coſtly</hi> Offering, <hi>will the Lord be pleas'd,</hi> ſays he, <hi>with ten Thouſand Rivers of Oyl?</hi> Micah 6.7. and in Abundance of Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Increaſe of <hi>Oyl</hi> ſignifies the Increaſe of <hi>Riches.</hi> And therefore, to have a Soul plentifully ſtored with divine Graces and Vertues, whereby we lay up a <hi>Treaſure in Heaven</hi> and become <hi>rich towards God,</hi> being the <hi>greateſt</hi> and only <hi>true</hi> and <hi>durable Riches;</hi> is very aptly repreſented by having <hi>Oyl</hi> in our Veſſels and our Lamps.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Oyl</hi> was likewiſe among the Eaſterns a Symbol of the greateſt <hi>Honours,</hi> as is evident from the whole Story of the Bible, where we read that at the ſolemn Conſecration and Inauguration of <hi>Kings</hi> and Prieſts Oyl was always us'd, and that among the Jews by the Appointment of <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> and is ſtill in Uſe with us at the <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of our <hi>Kings,</hi> And therefore, very fit to repreſent thoſe Chriſtian Vertues which ſo highly <hi>enoble</hi> the Soul as to render
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103289:117"/>it like to God, holy as he is holy, pure as he is pure, perfect as he is perfect; and whereby through the Merits of Chriſt we become <hi>Kings and Prieſts to God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 1.6.</note> 
               <hi>and ſhall reign with him for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Oyl was an Emblem of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and much us'd therefore in <hi>Feaſts</hi> and Entertainments, as is evident not only from heathen Writers, but from holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. There we read of the <hi>Oyl of Joy and Gladneſs;</hi> and our Lord in his Directions concerning faſting, bids his Diſciples not make a vain glorious Shew of it by an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Sullenneſs</hi> and <hi>Down Look,</hi> disfiguring their Faces as the Hypocrites did: But thou, when thou faſteſt, ſays he, <hi>anoint thy Head that thou appear not unto Men to faſt; i. e.</hi> make Semblance rather by this means, as if thou wert going to a <hi>Feaſt.</hi> And <hi>David,</hi> when he recounts God's Goodneſs to him, ſays amongſt other things, <hi>thou haſt prepar'd a Table for me, thou haſt anointed my Head with Oyl and my Cup runneth over, Pſal.</hi> 23.5. which ſignifies the Happineſs of his Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in general as well as his being advanc'd to the Throne of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Many other Places there are of this Nature; but theſe are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſhew how fitly thoſe Chriſtian Graces are expreſs'd by <hi>Oyl,</hi> which cauſe the greateſt <hi>Joy</hi> and Satisfaction to a holy Soul, and the Practice of which is full of Pleaſure and unſpeakable Delight. <hi>Sincere Religion</hi> is the moſt <hi>chearing</hi> thing in the World, and a good Conſcience a continual
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:103289:117"/>Feaſt: Indeed, to <hi>rejoyce</hi> is only proper for a <hi>good Chriſtian,</hi> whoſe Mind is clear and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturb'd,</hi> and in conſtant <hi>Hope</hi> and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Happineſs of Heaven. But he, whoſe Mind is <hi>rack'd</hi> with a Senſe of his <hi>deep Guilt,</hi> and feels the Laſhes of an enrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Conſcience, and is terrified with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Fears of <hi>Damnation,</hi> has little Reaſon to have <hi>Joy</hi> or Comfort in any thing. <hi>Oyl</hi> therefore, or the Emblem of <hi>Joy</hi> and Chearfulneſs, is of nothing more aptly expreſſive than of the Graces of our holy Religion, <hi>whoſe</hi> Ways <hi>alone</hi> are indeed <hi>Ways of Pleaſantneſs and Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Virgins <hi>all ſlumbering and ſleeping</hi> while the Bridegroom <hi>tarry'd;</hi> is ſignified the <hi>Inadvertency</hi> and <hi>Frailty</hi> of even the <hi>beſt</hi> of Men. Becauſe this divine Bridegroom delayeth his Coming, we are all of us too apt to <hi>lay aſide</hi> the Thoughts of it; to think but little upon <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> as things a great Way off, and for which there will be Time enough to provide <hi>hereafter:</hi> And for want of due <hi>Advertency</hi> to theſe <hi>rouſing</hi> Subjects, we are apt to grow <hi>heavy</hi> in our Religious Performances, and ſuffer ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Drouzineſs</hi> to creep too much upon us. This made holy <hi>David</hi> call upon God ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>quicken</hi> him in his Righteouſneſs; and St <hi>Paul</hi> to exhort his Corinthians to <hi>awake</hi> to Righteouſneſs, and thus to rouze the Epheſians, <hi>awake thou that ſleepeſt:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5.14.</note> And in this ſpiritual Slumber (though the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable Frailty of humane Nature will in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:103289:118"/>Part be accepted as our Excuſe by our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Saviour, who <hi>knows</hi> and pities our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi> yet) even the <hi>beſt</hi> of us indulge our ſelves too much, and enter into the Number of the <hi>fooliſh</hi> Virgins, and endanger the Extinction of our Lamp through the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of our Virtues, and expoſe our ſelves to many Dangers and Temptations, and frequent Falls. For this Inadvertency to that great Truth, <hi>that the End of all things is at hand,</hi> is one great Reaſon why even the <hi>righteous</hi> fall ſeven times a Day; whereas would we oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>ſet our Lord before us</hi> as coming to <hi>judge the quick and the dead,</hi> and reflect, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the next Hour our Soul may be required of us by him that gave it, and ſo an End put for ever to our State of <hi>Probation,</hi> and an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverſible Sentence ſoon after be paſs'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us according to our Deſervings; we ſhould not dare to be ſo often <hi>mov'd</hi> from our Duty, but be careful and circumſpect and always upon our Guard, leſt that Day ſurprize us <hi>unawares,</hi> and while we drouze away our Opportunity our <hi>Lamps go out,</hi> and the Bridegroom call before we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to enter with him into the Marriage Chamber, and ſo the <hi>Door be ſhut.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It therefore highly concerns even the <hi>beſt</hi> of us, <hi>not to ſleep as do others, but to watch and be ſober, having our Loins girded about, and our Lights burning,</hi> as our Lord expreſſes it, and <hi>our ſelves like unto Men that wait for their Lord when he will return from the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that when he cometh and knocketh we
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:103289:118"/>may open to him immediately. Bleſſed are thoſe Servants whom the Lord when he cometh ſhall find thus watching; I verily I ſay unto you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 12.35, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>that he ſhall gird himſelf and make them ſit down to Meat,</hi> and (after the Manner of Bridegrooms) <hi>will come forth and ſerve them; i. e.</hi> will impart to them the Joys and Felicities of his heavenly Kingdom. And if he ſhall come in the <hi>ſecond</hi> or <hi>third Watch,</hi> that is, in the Time moſt addicted to Vanity and Inadvertency, as is <hi>Youth</hi> and <hi>Manhood; Bleſſed</hi> in a more eſpecial Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>are thoſe Servants.</hi> And what the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſaid to the Church of <hi>Sardis, Rev.</hi> 3.2. is very neceſſary Advice even to the <hi>beſt</hi> Man living, <hi>be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things that remain which are ready to die; for I have not found thy Works perfect before God.</hi> And what our Lord ſays, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.15. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be ſeriouſly conſider'd; <hi>Behold I come as a Thief, bleſſed is he that watcheth and keepeth his Garments, leſt he walk naked and they ſee his Shame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By a <hi>Cry being made at Midnight, behold the Bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to meet him; is</hi> very lively and movingly repreſented, how <hi>unexpectedly</hi> the Day of Judgment ſhall <hi>ſurprize</hi> the drouzy World, and how <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,</hi> for any thing we can tell to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Time of <hi>our Death</hi> may be, which is to <hi>us</hi> the Forerunner of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Midnight</hi> is a Time of great <hi>Silence,</hi> and deſtin'd to <hi>Reſt</hi> and a Forgetfulneſs of the Toils and Troubles of the Day; and <hi>then,</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:103289:119"/>ſuddain Outcries and Alarums are doubly ſcaring and affrighting, and ſeize with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Confuſion, Horror and Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And thus, when Men are in the <hi>Midſt</hi> of their <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> that ſpiritual <hi>Night,</hi> employ'd in Deeds of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to Eaſe and Luxury, and forgetful of the great Buſineſs of working out their Salvation; then ſhall that Time of Sorrows ſteal upon them as a Thief in the Night, the terrifying <hi>Cry</hi> ſhall be made, <hi>behold, the great Judge of the World cometh, go ye forth to meet him:</hi> For when they ſhall ſay <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Safety,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Then ſuddain Deſtruction cometh upon them as Travail upon a Woman with Child, and they ſhall not eſcape,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.3. <hi>Then ſhall the Kings of the Earth and the great Men and the rich Men,</hi> thoſe that were thought happy upon Earth, inſtead of going out <hi>to meet</hi> this Judg, <hi>hide themſelves in Dens, in Rocks and Mountains, and ſay to the Mountains and Rocks, fall on us and hide us from the Face of him that ſitteth on the Throne and from the Wrath of the Lamb</hi> for the great Day of his Wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand! <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>And no wonder if a <hi>guilty Wretch</hi> dreads to go <hi>meet</hi> his <hi>angry Judg;</hi> and all on the <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,</hi> with all his Stains and <hi>Pollutions</hi> about him, appear before <hi>his</hi> Tribunal who <hi>hateth Iniquity, and into whoſe Preſence no unclean thing can enter:</hi> And, who is a <hi>conſuming Fire,</hi> to thoſe who by their <hi>obſtinate</hi> Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:103289:119"/>have provoked him to become their Enemy.</p>
            <p>And ſince all this is ſo, a Man of any <hi>Thought,</hi> and that has any <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> of the <hi>ſad</hi> Condition of being thus <hi>ſurpriz'd</hi> and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the other World by ſo quick and unforeſeen a Summons (which no Man is ſure ſhall not be his Caſe, ſince many have been call'd away with little or no Warning, that have no more expected than we do now) a Man of any <hi>Thought</hi> and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of things will ſurely be mov'd by ſuch Conſiderations to <hi>ſhake off</hi> that fatal Drouzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which too eaſily beſets him, and by a conſtant Attendance to his Duty and Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for his Departure hence, be ready chearfully to obey his great Maſter's Call, <hi>whether at Even or at Midnight, or at the Cockcrowing, or in the Morning, leſt coming ſuddainly he find him ſleeping.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the <hi>wiſe</hi> Virgins ariſing and <hi>trimming their Lamps</hi> when that <hi>Midnight Cry</hi> was made, is repreſented the more than <hi>ordinary</hi> Care that even good Perſons ought to take when by <hi>Age</hi> or the Violence of any <hi>Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> the Time of their Departure hence ſeems to be near approaching, to <hi>enliven</hi> their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; and by putting a <hi>Recruit</hi> of Oyl into their Lamps, acquiring <hi>new</hi> Degrees of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, and warming their Souls with greater Ardors of Devotion and holy Love, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to go <hi>chearfully</hi> to <hi>meet their Lord. Then</hi> is the Time, when every ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſhould endeavour to <hi>adorn</hi> his Soul with
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:103289:120"/>all the Graces of the holy Religion he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, to improve every remaining Minute of his Time to this beſt of Purpoſes, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem</hi> the many Hours formerly miſpent in Vanity and Folly; and by frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the infinite <hi>Glory, Sanctity</hi> and <hi>Bliſs</hi> of that heavenly World to which he then ſo ſenſibly draws near, inflame his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires of being at the End of his weariſom Journey to it; and <hi>fit</hi> himſelf for the <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al unſpotted</hi> Enjoyments of that happy Place by having as little Commerce as is poſſible with this World below, and have <hi>his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in Heaven,</hi> which will ſo quickly be the Place of his everlaſting Abode.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>fooliſh</hi> Virgins ſaying to the <hi>wiſe; give us of your Oyl for our Lamps are gone out,</hi> is repreſented the <hi>Want of Preparation</hi> among the careleſs and <hi>inconſiderate</hi> for this ſo great and <hi>ſuddain Change;</hi> and their mighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation upon it, and the vain and inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Courſes they will take in their Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, to make up, if poſſible, their own <hi>Defects,</hi> by borrowing of others that have Souls better furniſh'd with Piety than theirs. And by the <hi>wiſe</hi> anſwering, <hi>not ſo, leſt there be not enough for us and you,</hi> and bidding them go rather and <hi>buy for themſelves;</hi> is ſhewn that 'tis utterly <hi>groundleſs</hi> to expect at that great Day of Retribution, when every Man ſhall be rewarded according to his <hi>own Works,</hi> to fare the better for the Sanctity of <hi>others,</hi> and that every Man has enough to do to work out his <hi>own</hi> Salvation, and muſt
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:103289:120"/>keep his <hi>Lamp</hi> alive with his <hi>own Oyl,</hi> muſt <hi>nouriſh</hi> his <hi>Soul</hi> with his <hi>own Vertue;</hi> for there <hi>was</hi> never, nor ever <hi>ſhall</hi> be any <hi>meer Man</hi> ſo holy and excellent but muſt return this ſame Anſwer as the wiſe Virgins did, to ſuch as ſhould beg them to beſtow ſome of their Vertues or Merits upon them, <hi>not ſo, leſt there be not enough for our ſelves and you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if this be true, what will become of the Popiſh Doctrin of Works of <hi>Supererro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation?</hi> If the <hi>beſt</hi> Man in the World has but Vertue enough to ſecure his <hi>own</hi> Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (and that through infinite <hi>Mercy</hi> too, and upon Account of the all-ſufficient Merits of Chriſt) where is there any left for him to beſtow upon others? But this is one of thoſe doctrins that bring much <hi>Mony</hi> into their <hi>Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,</hi> and therefore, right or wrong, they'l be ſure to maintain it.</p>
            <p>By the Bridegroom's <hi>coming</hi> while thoſe <hi>fooliſh</hi> Virgins went about ſo unlikely an Employment as then immediately to furniſh their Lamps with Oyl, which before were unregarded and ſuffer'd to go out, and the <hi>Door</hi> before they were provided <hi>being ſhut;</hi> is repreſented, the <hi>Invalidity, generally</hi> ſpeaking of a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance;</hi> that 'tis too <hi>late</hi> to <hi>begin</hi> to be good when the <hi>Bridegrom comes,</hi> and thoſe that would enter with him into the <hi>Marriage Chamber</hi> muſt be <hi>ready</hi> and prepar'd by a previous Courſe of holy Living, and that for ſome <hi>conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Time.</p>

            <p>This Hurry of the fooliſh Virgins at that Time to get Oyl for their Lamps, was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Effect of the Terrors of that <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night Call;</hi> had it not been for <hi>that,</hi> they would have drouz'd on ſtill in their thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Way of living, and in all Probability, had it prov'd a <hi>falſe</hi> Alarm, they would have return'd again to their Dream of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, when this their <hi>Fright</hi> was a little over. And ſo it is with thoſe that think not of Repentance till <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> ſtare 'em in the Face; they are <hi>then</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous ſorry for having offended God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee they are like to be for ever puniſh'd for it with the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; and <hi>wiſh</hi> they had liv'd <hi>better,</hi> and beg God to forgive 'em, and <hi>promiſe</hi> Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Time to come: But all this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeldom proceeds from Love to <hi>God</hi> or his holy <hi>Religion,</hi> as appears by their being as bad as ever, when God has been pleaſed to reſtore them to their former Health.

Notwithſtanding all the Hurry of the <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> to get Oyl for their Lamps upon this ſuddain Notice of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom's coming; becauſe their Lamps were before <hi>ſuffer'd to go out,</hi> we ſee the Door was <hi>ſhut</hi> upon them.</p>

            <p>By the <hi>wiſe</hi> Virgins that were <hi>ready,</hi> their <hi>going in with the Bridegroom to</hi> the Marriage Feaſt; is repreſented the great Happineſs of the ſincerely good, who by holy living are <hi>ready,</hi> and <hi>prepar'd</hi> for their Departure hence into the World of Spirits. That is, as there was great Preparation made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Bridegroom among the Jews and other <hi>Eaſterns,</hi> great Joy and Feſtivity, and which the <hi>Children of the Bride-Chamber,</hi> or thoſe that attended the Bridegroom, did partake of, ſinging <hi>Epithalamiums</hi> or nuptial Songs in Praiſe of the Bridegroom and his Bride, and rejoycing in their Happineſs and wiſhing them long Proſperity: So, the Joys of the <hi>higheſt Heavens</hi> (which are the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Chamber of this divine Bridegroom our Saviour) in the Society of innumerable Saints and Angels and glorified Spirits, are prepar'd for thoſe that love our Lord Jeſus in Sincerity; and by a conſtant holy Life, are ready to leave theſe earthly Habitations, and enter with him into that holy Place: Where they ſhall enjoy a moſt blisful Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for ever ſinging Halleluja's to the Praiſe and Honour of that <hi>glorious Name,</hi> in which all the Nations of the World are bleſſed; <hi>praiſing God and ſaying,</hi>

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103289:122"/>will procure an Entrance into that holy Place, where Chriſt is ſitting at the right Hand of God; and make us Sharers in the Joys of Angels, and in the Happineſs of our dear Redeemer!</p>
            <p>In the <hi>laſt</hi> place; by the <hi>fooliſh</hi> Virgins coming after the Door was <hi>ſhut,</hi> and ſaying, <hi>Lord, Lord, open unto us,</hi> and his anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I know you not;</hi> is expreſs'd the ſad and <hi>remidileſs</hi> Condition of thoſe whom Death and Judgment ſurprize <hi>unawares,</hi> and that are not <hi>prepar'd</hi> by a <hi>holy Life.</hi> They may cry, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> long enough in the Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs and Anguiſh of their Souls, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that they believe in him and are his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, and call'd by his Name, <hi>that they have eat and drunk in his Preſence, and that he hath taught in their Streets,</hi> and the like: but yet, for all this, without a conſtant <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering Piety,</hi> Chriſt will tell them <hi>I know you not whence you are, depart from me all ye that work Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, what inconceivable <hi>Agonies</hi> will thoſe excluded Wretches then be in! What <hi>Horror</hi> and <hi>Deſpair</hi> will then take Seiſure of their Souls!

No <hi>Words</hi> can ever reach thoſe Horrors, nor can our Thoughts <hi>conceive</hi> them; and may none of us ever be ſo unhappy as to <hi>feel</hi> them!

            </p>
            <p>And thus have I given a particular, plain and practical Interpretation of this Parable of the <hi>Ten Virgins,</hi> whereof five were <hi>wiſe</hi> and five fooliſh; and ſhewn as I went along how aptly expreſſive it is of the Senſe our Lord couch'd under it.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to the other thing to be done, which is to urge that <hi>Watchfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Preparation</hi> by all manner of holy living againſt this coming of our Lord, which is neceſſary to our being admitted into his Joy; and to ſhew, how great the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of ſo doing is, and how great the <hi>Folly</hi> of the Contrary: For thoſe that were <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>trimm'd</hi> their Lamps are call'd <hi>wiſe</hi> Virgins in the Parable; and thoſe that were <hi>not</hi> ready, and their Lamps <hi>out</hi> are call'd <hi>fooliſh.</hi>

            <p>As for the <hi>Folly</hi> of not taking Care to be ready and prepar'd againſt that great Change of <hi>Death</hi> ſhall come; it is a thing juſtly to be wonder'd at, that Men who know that one Time or other they muſt ſurely <hi>die,</hi> and are wholly in the Dark as to the <hi>preciſe Time</hi> of their Death, and that they muſt die but once, and that, without any any further <hi>Probation,</hi> after Death comes <hi>Judgment;</hi> it is much to be wonder'd at that thoſe who know all this to be true, as Chriſtians are ſuppos'd to do, ſhould live ſo much at <hi>random,</hi> and be ſo fooliſhly careleſs in managing their <hi>laſt Stake,</hi> ſo heedleſs in doing that <hi>well</hi> which admits of no <hi>Repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and which, if done <hi>ill</hi> they are for ever <hi>miſerable.</hi> 'Tis the very Height of <hi>Folly</hi> this, and which, one would think, a Man of any Senſe could not be guilty of.

They look upon Death as the <hi>greateſt</hi> of Evils, and yet <hi>regard</hi> it the leaſt of all things; they know it highly concerns 'em to make Preparation for it by a good Life, and they know the ſad Conſequence if it ſurprize 'em unawares, and they are not ſure they ſhall not be ſurpriz'd the next Hour or Minute; and yet for all this they put the evil Day far from them, and by all Arts endeavour to <hi>remove</hi> ſuch melancholy Thoughts as if they were reſolv'd not to <hi>avoid</hi> but <hi>ſuffer</hi> what they fear, and <hi>ſecure</hi> to themſelves the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries conſequent upon an untimely and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd Death. And what is this, but juſt the ſame Piece of <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Madneſs,</hi> as for a Man becauſe he greatly dreads the <hi>Plague</hi> therefore to run into an <hi>infected Houſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is afraid of <hi>Poverty</hi> therefore to grow <hi>prodigal</hi> and ſquander away what he hath? And what can be more ſtrangely fooliſh and contradictious than this? Indeed, a Sinners <hi>whole Life</hi> is the greateſt <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Contradiction,</hi> but 'tis moſt groſs and <hi>palpable</hi> with Relation to <hi>dying;</hi> for, becauſe a Man loves his <hi>Body,</hi> therefore <hi>ſo</hi> to <hi>indulge</hi> it in <hi>this</hi> World as to make it become eternally <hi>miſerable</hi> in the <hi>next,</hi> and live in ſuch a Courſe of ſinful Pleaſures as will be repaid with a <hi>double</hi> Death, is unaccountably fooliſh and againſt all the Dictates even of natural Reaſon.</p>
            <pb n="226" facs="tcp:103289:125"/>
            <p>I need not ſay more I think to expoſe the Folly of not making Preparation for ſo great a Change as Death will effect in every Man's Condition; or (in the Phraſe of this Parable) of not keeping <hi>Oyl in our Lamps,</hi> nor watching againſt the divine Bridegroom's coming, but ſlumbering in a careleſs Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency to thoſe great things of Religion, <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> till they overtake us as a <hi>Thief in the Night.</hi> And from what has been ſaid of the <hi>Folly</hi> of <hi>not</hi> preparing for that Time of Terrors and greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to every Man, we may in a few Words collect the great <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of being always in a <hi>Readineſs</hi> to obey the Summons of our great Lord with <hi>Chearfulneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For in ſhort, to be <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>prepar'd to die</hi> when God ſhall pleaſe to call us, has all the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in it of making a conſtant due Proviſion againſt the greateſt and moſt <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi> Change that can befall us; and which we muſt <hi>certainly</hi> undergo, and how <hi>ſoon</hi> we know not, and that but <hi>once</hi> neither, and which will be follow'd by the final <hi>Judgment</hi> without any <hi>new Opportunity</hi> being afforded, wherein to <hi>amend</hi> the Errors of our then irrecoverably paſt Life: 'Tis to make <hi>ſuch</hi> a Preparation for this great Change as may render it <hi>advantageous</hi> to us whenever it ſhall come, than which no greater Piece of Wiſdom can be imagin'd: For that certainly is the greateſt Wiſdom that makes a Man <hi>wiſe to Salvation.</hi>

            <pb n="227" facs="tcp:103289:125"/>
            <p>Wherefore, to conclude this Parable. Since <hi>it is appointed to Men once to dye, and after that the Judgment;</hi> or, in the Stile of this Parable, ſince Jeſus the divine Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom will one time come to ſummon every particular Member of the Chriſtian Church, his myſtical Spouſe, to leave <hi>this</hi> World and attend him in the World of <hi>Spirits,</hi> there to partake with him (if ready and adorn'd with the Wedding Garment, and their Lamps burning with the Oyl of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs) of the everlaſting Felicities of this heavenly Kingdom; or elſe, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to appear before him <hi>then,</hi> to be for ever <hi>excluded</hi> his Preſence, and thruſt into the dire Abodes of the Devil and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: Since this is ſo, let us all make it our ſincere Endeavour, by a ſerious and hearty Obſervation of thoſe holy Rules of living which our Lord has mark'd out to us as the Way to Immortality and a Preparation for his Appearance, to be always ready to go out and meet him; that we may enter with him into the Marriage Chamber before the Door be ſhut, and not hear that diſmal Sound, <hi>I know ye not, depart from me ye Workers of Iniqutity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe this great Coming of the Bridegroom will be but <hi>once,</hi> for 'tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to Men but <hi>once</hi> to dye, and after that but <hi>one final Judgment;</hi> let us by no means trifle away this <hi>only</hi> Opportunity of working out our Salvation in Folly and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency, much leſs in <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> and

               <hi>Vice;</hi> but often reflect upon the Agonies we ſhall feel when we ſhall find this <hi>one only</hi> Life which we have ſo wretchedly miſpent, drawing to a <hi>Concluſion,</hi> and no Hopes of any further Opportunity to <hi>recover</hi> our ſelves in, but juſt as we <hi>then</hi> are in that deplorable <hi>unprepar'd</hi> Condition, be hurried away to give Account of our Works.

            <p>If this be a Caſe <hi>infinitely deplorable</hi> (and if this be <hi>not,</hi> certainly nothing is) then it nearly concerns us all while we have Time, that is, while this <hi>one only</hi> Life does laſt, to make Proviſion for a <hi>happy Departure</hi> out of it, by a more holy and circumſpect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in it.

               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:103289:129"/>who yet took no charitable Notice of him, but <hi>paſſed by on the other Side;</hi> or the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> who though a ſchiſmatical Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Common Wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and an Enemy to every <hi>Jew,</hi> yet had Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on him and reliev'd and ſuccour'd him with Charity ſuitable to his Diſtreſs? To this the Lawyer anſwer'd as he could not chooſe but do, <hi>he</hi> was his Neighbour that <hi>ſhew'd Mercy on him.</hi> Then ſaid Jeſus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to him, <hi>Go and do thou likewiſe.</hi> Which Words ſtruck home upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that they put a Stop to his intended <hi>Juſtification</hi> of himſelf, and we hear of no further Intercourſe he had with our Lord; and may imagine how he ſneak'd away aſham'd and confounded.</p>
            <p>The Deſign therefore of this Parable is to give us a true Notion of <hi>Charity,</hi> or Compaſſion and Relief of ſuch as are in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; and that both with Reſpect to the <hi>Object</hi> of it, and the <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Meaſure</hi> of <hi>expreſſing</hi> it to ſuch Object. And therefore in diſcourſing upon this Parable I ſhall do three things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall ſhew who are the proper <hi>Objects</hi> of this Sort of Charity, according to the true Senſe and Meaning of our holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> How we are obliged to <hi>relieve</hi> them, in what <hi>Manner</hi> and in what <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What great <hi>Encouragement</hi> we have to this excellent Duty, with reſpect
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:103289:129"/>both to <hi>this</hi> World, and that <hi>above;</hi> or what a Bleſſedneſs it is to be able thus to <hi>give</hi> rather than <hi>receive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As for the proper <hi>Objects</hi> of this Charity, they are in general the <hi>really</hi> Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and Calamitous, and ſuch as are una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to help <hi>themſelves.</hi> And that (without <hi>excepting</hi> any) whether they be Strangers and Foreigners, or Enemies, or Heathens, or Hereticks, or wicked Perſons: <hi>All</hi> that are <hi>indeed</hi> neceſſitous and helpleſs, are made by our holy and moſt merciful Religion, the Objects of our Compaſſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>As we have Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, let us do good unto all Men,</hi> Gal. 6.10. and our Lord, <hi>Do good to them that hate you,</hi> Mat. 5.44. and Rom. 12.20. <hi>If thy Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hunger feed him, if he thirſt give him Drink;</hi> and in this Parable our Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to our Imitation the Example of a <hi>Samaritan</hi> taking great Care of an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Jew,</hi> though there could be no greater <hi>Enmity</hi> than between the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans,</hi> and that grounded upon what of all things makes Ill Will the moſt invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, <hi>Diverſity of Opinion in Religion.</hi> And indeed, 'twould be a barbarous Piece of Cruelty and Inhumanity, if I ſhould let a Man <hi>periſh,</hi> without any Commiſeration or Help from me when I am able to give it him, becauſe he has formerly, it may be, been unkind or injurious to me, or is of a different Religion, and of a Nation that is in Hoſtility with that to which I belong.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:103289:130"/>This certainly is not doing as I would be done to, nor loving my Neighbour as my ſelf, for every Man in a religious Senſe is my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; 'tis more like the Rage of a <hi>Tiger</hi> than the Bowels of a Man, or the <hi>Malice</hi> of a <hi>Devil</hi> than the <hi>Charity</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> As for Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Strangers and Foreigners, that is expreſly commanded in ſeveral Places of Scripture, particularly 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.9. where what we tranſlate <hi>uſe Hoſpitality one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> is in the Original, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Be kind to Strangers;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hob. 13.2.</note> and by the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the Probability of receiving <hi>Angels</hi> unawares in that Diſguiſe (as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.3. and 19.2.) is made the Motive to it. And how excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Piece of Charity this is, and how conducive to the Prevention of much Sin and Miſery, I need not ſpend much Time to prove: There are few that have liv'd any conſiderable Time in the World, and have ſeen more Parts of it than one, but have ſome Time or other, either taſted the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> of an <hi>hoſpitable</hi> Diſpoſition or <hi>ſmarted</hi> for the <hi>Want</hi> of it; and ſuch Men are the fitteſt to tell their Thoughts of either: That is, how inhumane 'tis to be without Bowels to an indigent Stranger, and how happy Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind would be in every Place, were the Orders of the great Governour of the World duly obſerv'd in this Matter. And as for <hi>wicked</hi>-Perſons, who <hi>deſerve</hi> the leaſt Compaſſion of any, if they are in other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects real Objects of Charity, their Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:103289:130"/>muſt not put a Bar to it; for we are to imitate the Example of the merciful God, who is <hi>kind and Beneficent to the unthankful and to the evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this is to be underſtood with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect only to the <hi>really</hi> neceſſitous and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, whoſe Wants and Calamities are not feign'd; and who are unable to help <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> to better Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>For there are a very vile Sort of People, who make a Trade of going about from Houſe to Houſe and with doleful Accents, and a forlorn Appearance and formal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints endeavour to melt People into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards them; who yet are far from being Objects of this Sort of Charity; their Neceſſities being <hi>counterfeit,</hi> or at leaſt they being very well able to ſupply them by their own Labour if they would: 'Tis well known how gainful they make this lazy Courſe of Life, how unwilling they are to <hi>work</hi> when any would employ them; how much abominable Debauchery there is in thoſe vagrant Societies, and how great a Peſt they are to the Publick; they being no better than a Band of Villains and Robbers, and unprofitable idle Drones, that live upon the Labour and Spoil of others, and are no Way uſeful or ſerviceable themſelves: And therefore to <hi>relieve</hi> their pretended Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, is to encourage the worſt Men liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Courſe of Life highly diſhonourable to God, injurious to the State, and ruinous to their own Souls. Nay further, 'tis to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:103289:131"/>deprive thoſe that <hi>indeed</hi> deſerve our Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conſiderable Supplies, which are, though <hi>inſenſibly</hi> beſtow'd upon thoſe vile Wretches; and were it computed, what ſome charitable Perſons give in a Year in Mony to common Beggars at their Doors or otherwiſe, 'twould amount to a Sum big enough to cheer the Hearts of many <hi>Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> and Widows, and decay'd Houskeepers that are in greater <hi>Want</hi> than thoſe Vagrants, though not ſo whining and ſo affectedly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and ragged. And 'twould be worth while for a Perſon that has us'd hitherto to ſcatter his Charity among thoſe <hi>counterfeit</hi> Objects of it, to try the Experiment what ſuch Gifts would amount to in a Twelve Month's Time, by laying <hi>aſide</hi> what he would otherwiſe have beſtow'd that Way, whenever he is importun'd by ſuch Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es for an Alms; and then ſee whether he can't diſpoſe of it to better Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Indeed, <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Correction</hi> is the beſt Sort of Charity to ſuch Kind of Beggars. And would Men in Authority reſolve to do their Duty in this Matter, and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons reſolve to ſend ſuch Vagabonds away empty, and with Reproof and Shame, the Caſe would ſoon be altered, and they would find it better to work than ſtarve, and look upon honeſt Induſtry more eligible than the Laſh. Much Wickedneſs would by this Means be prevented, and it would be a double and treble Charity; 'twould provide for the Happineſs of both Body and Soul of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:103289:131"/>ſuch as ſhould be reformed by it from ſuch a helliſh Courſe of Life; 'twould be a great Benefit to the Publick, and Men would find themſelves more able to ſupport ſuch as are <hi>really</hi> oppreſs'd with Want, and utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to help <hi>themſelves.</hi> And ſuch Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours as this to ſturdy Vagrants, however harſh and ſevere it may ſeem to ſome indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreetly compaſſionate Perſons, is plainly commanded by the great Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. <hi>He that will not work, neither let him eat.</hi> He that <hi>Will</hi> not work, that is, that appears to be able to labour but rather chuſes an idle wandring Life; and there is not One in Twenty of our common Beggars, but are of this Sort, hail and luſty and ſtrong, and in more Heart and better fed than many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and <hi>induſtrious</hi> People: And they that can travel as they do around the Kingdom, we can't ſuppoſe, whatever they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, to be incapable of Labour.</p>
            <p>Indeed, ſometimes a <hi>real</hi> Object of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may preſent it ſelf at ones Door or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, ſuch as the blind and aged and maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the like, and theſe, no Queſtion, ought to be <hi>reliev'd;</hi> but there being ſo many <hi>Counterfeits,</hi> and the ill Conſequence of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing ones charity upon them being ſo very great; He is very <hi>indiſcreet</hi> in beſtowing his Alms that will not be firſt very well ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether they are what they <hi>pretend</hi> to be, and deſerve his Charity or no.</p>
            <p>But this Severity muſt be uſed with <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and he that does deſerve <hi>Correction</hi> as
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:103289:132"/>a Vagrant, may yet by ſome calamitous Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident in following his lew'd Trade, be at preſent in urgent Neceſſity of <hi>Relief;</hi> and here the Way is, firſt to ſupply the <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> and afterwards in due Time to ſuperadd the <hi>Correction.</hi> For I muſt let no Man, how wicked ſoever, periſh if I can prevent it; and as I am in Charity bound, by <hi>Severity</hi> when the Man is able to bear it, to provide for the Safety of his <hi>Soul,</hi> ſo by a timely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief likewiſe when there is <hi>urgent</hi> Need of it to ſupport his <hi>Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that upon the Whole, all that want are to be releiv'd, but 'tis after a different Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the Charity muſt be adapted to the Neceſſity; to the Widow and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, the Naked, the Hungry, the Sick and the Helpleſs muſt be miniſtred Comfort and Support; but to ſturdy lazy Travellers (as they call themſelves) the <hi>Laſh</hi> and <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>rough</hi> Treatment; and this, however harſhly it may ſound, is the greater Charity of the Two.</p>
            <p>And thus much in <hi>general</hi> for the firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry occaſion'd by this Parable, <hi>viz.</hi> who are the proper Objects of this Kind of Charity, according to the Intent of our holy Religion, or in the Words of the Lawyer to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>who is our Neighbour</hi> in this Reſpect? I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Enquiry, <hi>How</hi> we are oblig'd to <hi>expreſs</hi> this Charity to the proper Objects of it, in what <hi>Manner</hi> and in what <hi>Meaſure?</hi> And in <hi>general,</hi> as to the <hi>Manner</hi> of reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:103289:132"/>it muſt be adapted to the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> to be relieved; and as to the <hi>Meaſure,</hi> it muſt likewiſe be ſuitable to the <hi>Degree</hi> of the <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> and to the <hi>Ability</hi> of the Perſon that relieves it. But, to do Juſtice to this Enquiry, we muſt be more <hi>particular,</hi> and ſhall therefore reduce the Neceſſities of the Objects of our Charity to theſe three Heads; <hi>Poverty, Sickneſs,</hi> and <hi>Loſs of Liberty,</hi> and ſhew the <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Meaſure</hi> of relieving each.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Poverty,</hi> it may be of ſeveral Kinds, and may conſiſt either in Want of Meat and Drink, or of Cloaths, or of a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, or in a forlorn Widow-hood, and Loſs of Parents; <hi>i. e.</hi> in ſuch an urgent Want of Neceſſaries for Life as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are utterly unable, at leaſt for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to ſupply themſelves withal, and ſuch a Loſs of Husband or Parent, as leaves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of ſuch Neceſſaries, and of Means to procure them.</p>
            <p>Now in caſe of ſuch Poverty, the Relief muſt be ſuited to the <hi>moſt urgent</hi> Neceſſity; he that is hungry muſt be ſupplied with Meat, and the thirſty with Drink, the nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Cloathing ſufficient to keep out the Injuries of the Weather, Strangers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs'd Travellers with Lodging, and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and ſuch as have been Houſe keepers but are fall'n to Decay, with convenient Habitations, and a competent Subſiſtence; and the Fatherleſs with good Education, and a Paternal Care in diſpoſing of them to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:103289:133"/>Trades and Employments, whereby they ſhall be enabled to provide for themſelves. And if any ſhould be ſo deſtitute of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort as to want moſt or all of theſe Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they muſt be ſupply'd with all, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with that of which there is the moſt <hi>need;</hi> or elſe with a competent Piece of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10.19.</note> which, as the wiſe Man ſays, <hi>anſwers all things.</hi> But this <hi>laſt</hi> muſt be underſtood only with reſpect to a poor Man that is in ſuch Circumſtances, as that, he can, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great Inconvenience, ſhift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and with the Mony given him provide what is neceſſary: But when a Man is in ſuch preſent urgent neceſſity, whether of Food, or Drink, or Rayment, or Lodging, or the like; that he will be in great Danger of periſhing, if his Wants be not <hi>quickly</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, and the Diſtance from publick Places of Entertainment great, and the Seaſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme; in theſe and the like Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 'twould be but a mock piece of Charity to give Mony and take no farther Care of him; there muſt be <hi>particular</hi> Proviſion made for ſuch a Man's <hi>particular</hi> Wants, and that <hi>immediately</hi> and without Delays. Thus for Inſtance, ſuppoſe a poor Man ſhould come to any one's Houſe in a ſharp Winter, and dark Night approaching, cold and faint, and hungry and weary, and beg for Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and that Pity might be had of his ſad Condition, and ſome Releif afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and ſuppoſe the Maſter of the Houſe ſhould refuſe to take him in, or let
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:103289:133"/>him refreſh himſelf with him, but withal give him a Piece of Mony, and tell him that two or three Miles off there is a Town, where for that Mony he may have Supply of his Wants, and ſo ſend him away; and ſuppoſe this poor Wretch ſhould either faint by the Way or miſs of it, and in the weak Condition he is in, be forced to lie abroad, and by the Morning be found quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the rigorous Seaſon, and ſtarv'd to Death: In this Caſe what will the Man's <hi>dry</hi> Charity avail him? Or rather, ſhall he not anſwer for the Death of that diſtreſs'd Creature, when he could have prevented it but would not?</p>
            <p>The Manner of the good Samaritan's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and ſuccouring the unfortunate Jew in the Parable, though by his different Way of Religion, quite eſtrang'd from the Jews, is a remarkable Example of a <hi>thorough</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. When he came near and ſaw what a ſad Condition the Thieves had leſt the poor Man in, deſpoil'd of his Mony and his Cloaths, and wounded and left half-dead; he firſt applies himſelf to the Relief of the greateſt Neceſſity, and binds up his Wounds, pouring in Oyl and Wine. And then, not thinking <hi>that</hi> a ſufficient Charity to a Man in his Condition, he ſet him on his own Beaſt, and brought him to an Inn, and took farther Care of his Refreſhment, and ſtay'd there with him till the morrow to ſee that he had what was convenient for him; and becauſe his perfect Recovery would be a
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:103289:134"/>thing of Time, he leaves Mony with the Hoſt, and a Charge to look well after him, and promiſes that whatever was ſpent more upon that poor Man's Account, when he came again he would repay. This was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a <hi>compleat</hi> Relief, and manag'd with as much <hi>Diſcretion</hi> as <hi>Compaſſion,</hi> and our Lord's Application is, <hi>Go and do thou like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi> In all Caſes of this Nature, the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the poor muſt be conſider'd, and the Relief ſuited accordingly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the Manner of expreſſing our Charity to the <hi>ſick,</hi> 'tis in ſhort to make fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Viſits of Comfort to them, to refreſh their <hi>Spirits</hi> by Pious Diſcourſes of the Power and Goodneſs and Wiſdom of that God who ſends the Affliction, who can <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move</hi> it if he thinks fit, and whoſe <hi>chaſtning</hi> is an Argument of his <hi>Love;</hi> and that if he ſtill <hi>continues</hi> it, his Wiſdom ſees it will be for the <hi>beſt at laſt;</hi> that ſo they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to hope and truſt in God, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſubmit to his good Pleaſure: And 'tis to ſupply likewiſe what is neceſſary for their Attendance and Recovery. The poorer ſort ſhould expreſs their Charity in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by <hi>perſonal</hi> Attendance and Service; and the more wealthy by providing things neceſſary, and overlooking and directing to what is convenient. And this is a moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Piece of Charity, and provides for the Health of the <hi>Soul</hi> as well as the Body, and nothing can be more ſeaſonable and <hi>well-tim'd.</hi> For in Time of Sickneſs the <hi>whole
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:103289:134"/>Man</hi> is dejected, and the Spirit which ſhould bear up his Infirmity, is then it <hi>ſelf,</hi> for the moſt part, <hi>wounded;</hi> through the near Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the other World and the bold Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of Conſcience, which <hi>then,</hi> unleſs quite ſear'd is loud and clamorous. Then the Man is leaſt of all able to help <hi>himſelf,</hi> and the Charge of Sickneſs is great, and he that was poor in <hi>Health,</hi> when <hi>ſick</hi> is doubly poor; and indeed there is no greater Object of Pity and Compaſſion than a poor ſick Man. And as <hi>all</hi> Charity muſt be univerſal without excepting even <hi>Enemies;</hi> ſo in <hi>this</hi> caſe, our Enemies ſhould be the Objects of our Charity to <hi>chooſe.</hi> For upon a ſick-Bed 'tis moſt likely that they <hi>will</hi> be reconcil'd, and 'tis highly neceſſary than then they <hi>ſhould</hi> be; for Sickneſs often ends in Death, and no Man can tell but <hi>that</hi> Sickneſs which his Enemy then lies under may be his <hi>laſt:</hi> And 'tis a miſerable thing to die in <hi>Enmity.</hi> And therefore, before it be too late, whoever is at variance with a ſick Man ſhould go to him and endeavour a Reconcilement; if he hath injur'd the <hi>ſick</hi> in any reſpect he ſhould ask his Pardon, and make him Satisfaction and Reſtitution; and if the ſick Man has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd <hi>him,</hi> he ſhould go to him to let him know that he freely forgives him, and deſires that all Ill-Will may be at at End for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And at that Time, when the Spirit is uſually more ſoftned and compliant than in Health, and the Soul more awaken'd and ſenſible of her Duty, 'tis very probable he
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:103289:135"/>will hearken, and the Man will gain his Brother. And 'tis a great Charity indeed to eaſe a ſick Man's Mind of the deviliſh and tormenting Paſſions of Malice and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; it provides for Peace and Amity for the future ſhould he <hi>recover,</hi> and ſhould he <hi>dye,</hi> it makes his Account much eaſier at the Day of Judgment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As for Charity to ſuch as are depriv'd of their <hi>Liberty,</hi> the <hi>Manner</hi> of it conſiſts in viſiting and diſcourſing comfortably to them, and in endeavouring by the beſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods we can to procure their Enlargement; and in the mean time, in helping them to Neceſſaries, and perſwading their Keepers to be kind to them, and uſe them tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And if they are impriſon'd for <hi>Grimes,</hi> 'tis to endeavour to make them ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Guilt of them before <hi>God,</hi> and that unleſs they ſincerely repent of them, an eternal Bondage in Chains of Darkneſs, and in the loweſt Hell, ſhall come in the Place of the Dungeon, their Iron Shackles, and temporary Confinement. And the Objects of this Piece of Charity are as before <hi>all,</hi> Enemies as well as Friends, Strangers and Foreigners, as well as Neighbours and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</p>
            <p>Under this Head of the <hi>Manner</hi> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing our Charity to the Neceſſitous, it is proper to enquire what <hi>Preference</hi> may be made of one Object of Charity before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if more ſhould offer themſelves than one Man can relieve, at leaſt at the <hi>ſame</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:103289:135"/>time? For our Direction in this matter, St. <hi>Paul</hi> has left us two general Rules, the one, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. where he ſays, <hi>as we have Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity let us do good unto all Men; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to thoſe that are of the Houſhold of Faith,</hi> in which we are taught to prefer <hi>Chriſtians</hi> before <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> when there is no Help but <hi>one</hi> muſt be preferr'd; and among Chriſtians, to prefer in like Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances the pious and ſincerely good, before ſuch as live not agreeably to their holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, for ſuch only as have the <hi>Power</hi> of Godlineſs, are properly of the Houſhold of Faith. The other Rule is in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. in theſe Words, <hi>If any provide not for his own, eſpecially thoſe of his own Houſe,</hi> or Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, <hi>he has denyed the Faith,</hi> &amp;c. and here we are directed, if a Preference <hi>muſt</hi> be made, to make it in Favour of our <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Relatives</hi> before ſuch as are <hi>Strangers</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>But theſe Rules muſt be thus explained. As <hi>firſt,</hi> where 'tis <hi>impoſſible</hi> for us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with <hi>all</hi> Opportunities of doing good, there this Preference is to be made; but when we <hi>can</hi> we muſt do good to <hi>all.</hi> And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> When the Neceſſities of <hi>pious</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and our <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> are <hi>equally great</hi> and <hi>urgent with</hi> thoſe of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and Strangers to us, there likewiſe our Charity ſhould begin at <hi>Home:</hi> But thirdly, when the Diſtreſs of an <hi>Ill</hi> Man or a <hi>Stranger</hi> is <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>more urgent</hi> than that of a <hi>good</hi> Man or my Friend and Relative, ſo
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:103289:136"/>that the <hi>former</hi> will be in danger of periſhing unleſs <hi>immediately</hi> reliev'd, and the <hi>latter</hi> will <hi>not,</hi> but may ſafely tarry longer: Then there muſt be no Reſpect of Perſons, but the <hi>greateſt</hi> Neceſſity, where-ever it be found, muſt be <hi>firſt</hi> reliev'd.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add but one thing more relating to the <hi>Manner</hi> of expreſſing our Charity, and that is what St. <hi>Peter</hi> adviſes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.9. that it be done without <hi>grudging.</hi> The Word in the Original is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies <hi>murmuring,</hi> or an <hi>unwillingneſs</hi> in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing, as if 'twere torn and <hi>forc'd</hi> from one, rather than proceeded from a <hi>free Inclination.</hi> And this hateful churliſh way of Alms-giving, St. <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbids, and ſays, our Charity muſt not be ſhewn <hi>grudgingly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 9.7.</note> 
               <hi>or as of Neceſſity,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. <hi>He that ſheweth Mercy, let him do it with Chearfulneſs;</hi> according to the Example which God himſelf hath ſet us, <hi>Who giveth to every Man liberally,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 1.5.</note> 
               <hi>and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here, I can't but admire and adore the infinite Goodneſs of God; who has not only oblig'd us to the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of this Duty, but has ſo order'd the very <hi>Circumſtantials</hi> of it; that the neceſſitous may be reliev'd with as much <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Eaſe</hi> to themſelves as can be, and the Alms of others look ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like their own <hi>Propriety,</hi> as the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Debt, or reſtoring of a Pledge, or beſtowing a Reward; and that their <hi>Souls</hi> might not be griev'd by Frowns and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:103289:136"/>Taunts, and unkind Language, when they receive Supply for the Needs of their <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy!</hi> For Man as well as God loves a <hi>chearful</hi> Giver; and a Benefit that comes <hi>hardly,</hi> and with Shews of <hi>Unwillingneſs,</hi> is much <hi>leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in its Value; and a Man of a generous Spirit would prefer a <hi>Mite</hi> given with a <hi>free</hi> Heart and Words of <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> before the <hi>Largeſs</hi> of an <hi>Emperour,</hi> if he muſt ſuffer <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braidings</hi> for it, and <hi>opprobrious</hi> Treatment. <hi>Super Omnia, Vultus acceſſere Boni,</hi> ſays <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race:</hi> All the Delicates at his Friends Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment would have reliſh'd but very indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently, had not a <hi>chearful Countenance</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd him of his <hi>Welcome.</hi> And if a <hi>free</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be given in <hi>ſecret</hi> too,
<note place="margin">Mat. 6.4.</note> as our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf directs, the poor Man will not be ſo much as put to the <hi>Bluſh</hi> for what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives; and will come ſhort of the rich in nothing that is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and be free from the <hi>Vexations</hi> that attend an opulent Condition; and the Advantage of the Wealthy over the Poor would then conſiſt chiefly in <hi>this,</hi> That they are by God's Providence enabled to be the <hi>Supporters of the weak;</hi> it being accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Words of the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 20.35.</note> 
               <hi>more bleſſed to give than to receive:</hi> Eſpecially if we in the</p>
            <p>Next Place, conſider the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of this Charity. And in general, it muſt be equal to the <hi>Neceſſities</hi> of the Poor, or at leaſt agreeable to every Man's <hi>Ability.</hi> A <hi>great</hi> Neceſſity muſt have a <hi>great</hi> Supply; as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a whole <hi>Family</hi> be in want, the Relief
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:103289:137"/>ought to be greater than to a <hi>ſingle</hi> Perſon: If a <hi>Forreigner</hi> is diſtreſs'd and has not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to carry him to his own Country, <hi>he</hi> ſhould be more plentifully reliev'd than a Traveller that is in his Native Country and has comparatively but a little Way to go. He that is a Priſoner or Captive for a <hi>great</hi> Debt or Ranſom, ſhould receive more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally of our Charity than one that may be releas'd for <hi>leſs;</hi> the Neceſſities of a poor Man that is <hi>ſick</hi> being doubly great, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that is given him ſhould bear Proportion, and be more liberal than ordinary: And the more dangerous and laſting, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>chargeable</hi> the Sickneſs is, the Charity ſhould riſe the higher ſtill, and greater Care be had of him, and Viſits oftner made to him. He that is <hi>utterly</hi> helpleſs and uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of working, ought to receive more largely of our Charity than one that is in ſome Meaſure able to help and provide for himſelf. In theſe and all other Caſes of this Nature, he that has the greateſt need muſt have the greateſt <hi>Supply;</hi> and he that has the greateſt <hi>Ability,</hi> his Charity muſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, and he muſt give <hi>moſt.</hi> But to prevent all unneceſſary Scruples in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we ſhould remember, that Charity does not conſiſt in an <hi>Indiviſible</hi> Point, <hi>leſs</hi> than which ſhall not be accepted; for a <hi>Mite</hi> given with a free Heart and good Intention by a poor Widow that could afford no more, was not only <hi>accepted,</hi> but the Charity high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>commended</hi> by our Lord himſelf, and no
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:103289:137"/>doubt but was crown'd with a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The general Rule in this Caſe is that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. <hi>As every Man has receiv'd the Gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God.</hi> That is, every Man's Charity muſt be proportionable to his Ability; he that has much muſt give plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and he that has little muſt chearfully give of that little; and no Man that has any Share in this World's Good, muſt wholly ſhut up his Bowels of Compaſſion from his Brother that hath need. Remembring, <hi>That he that ſoweth ſparingly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 9.6.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall reap ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and he that ſoweth plenteouſly ſhall reap alſo plenteouſly.</hi> So that according to the Order of our good Creator, we ſee Riches are like our Blood, to <hi>circulate,</hi> and ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd in due Proportions to every Part of the great Body of Mankind: The greater Channels are to ſupply the leſſer, and the <hi>fuller</hi> they are the more they muſt <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate:</hi> And none muſt preſume upon Pain of the worſt of ill Conſequences to <hi>ſtop</hi> this Courſe, or divert it to unprofitable Uſes.</p>
            <p>When our <hi>own</hi> Needs and thoſe of our <hi>Relatives,</hi> are modeſtly and <hi>reaſonably</hi> ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and provided for, all the reſt God gives us to beſtow upon the poor and needy, 'tis their Inheritance; and we ſhall be unjuſt in our Stewardſhip if we with-hold it from them. And, in the Words of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Biſhop <hi>Taylor, Certainly there is not any greater Baſeneſs, than to ſuffer a Man to periſh
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:103289:138"/>or be in extreme want of</hi> that, <hi>which God gave me</hi> for <hi>him, and beyond my own Needs.</hi> And it muſt ever be remembred, That as Men's <hi>Eſtates</hi> increaſe, their <hi>Charity</hi> muſt in due Proportion increaſe likewiſe; it muſt not lie an uſeleſs Lump in a Cheſt, or be improv'd only to increaſe the Hoard, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to Luxury and Exceſs, or the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies of a prodigal Heir; but this Bleſſing of God muſt be diſtributed according to the Will of God, to ſweeten and alleviate the Miſeries of Man.</p>
            <p>And now, would Men but act according to this their Duty, what abundant Supply would there be for the Neceſſities of every one? That of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 49.9, 10. would then be <hi>literally</hi> fulfill'd, <hi>Say to the Priſoners, Go forth, to them that are in Darkneſs, ſhew your ſelves; they ſhall feed in the Ways, their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures ſhall be in all high Places. They ſhall not hunger nor thirſt, neither ſhall the Heat nor Sun ſmite them; for he that hath Mercy on them ſhall lead them, even by the Springs of Waters ſhall he guide them.</hi> How many bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Complaints, how many Sighs and Tears, how much Miſery, and how much Sin would by ſuch Charity be prevented? How many more might moſt Men relieve than they do? How very many might a Man of a large Eſtate take care of, and what vaſt Numbers of poor might have a very comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Subſiſtence, if <hi>all</hi> ſuch Men would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly perform their Duty in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? And with what <hi>Eaſe</hi> might this be
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:103289:138"/>done too? That which is every Day ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd away to no Purpoſe, or conſum'd in Vice and Vanity, could it be computed, would amount to a prodigious Sum; and were but <hi>ſo</hi> much beſtow'd in <hi>Charity</hi> by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich Man, as heedleſly and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſlips from him, how many would enjoy a comfortable Maintenance, who now want Neceſſaries, and are ready to be ſtarv'd, and all the while the rich Man be not diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the poorer for it? And if ſo <hi>little</hi> when rightly diſpos'd of would go ſo far in this bleſſed Work, what happy Effects ſhould we ſoon ſee, if Men of large Poſſeſſions would be perſwaded to obey their great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, and give <hi>largely</hi> of their Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance! And in order to this they would do well to remember, that Riches are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and intirely Men's <hi>own,</hi> but <hi>Talents</hi> committed to them by God to improve, and lay out to his Glory. That 'tis he that is the great <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Proprietor</hi> of all, and <hi>Men,</hi> how opulent ſoever, no other than his <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards;</hi> inrich'd on purpoſe that they may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thoſe that have need, and take care that none in this great Family of the World pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for want of what is needful for their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: And that, of the <hi>Diſcharge</hi> of this their Steward-ſhip, they muſt render an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at the Day of Judgment, the general Audit of all Mankind; and then, the faithful and good Stewards, that have fulfill'd their Lord's Command, and gave the poor of this great Family, <hi>their Portion of Meat in due Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:103289:139"/>ſhall be receiv'd into their Maſter's Joy: But the <hi>unfaithful</hi> and wicked Stewards, that were cruel and <hi>hard-hearted</hi> to their fellow-Servants, and only feaſted and pamper'd <hi>themſelves,</hi> grew exceſſive and luxurious with their Lord's Allowance, and <hi>did eat and drink with the Drunken;</hi> their Lord will <hi>come in a Day when they look not for him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 12.42.</note> and <hi>cut them aſunder, and appoint them their Portion with Unbelievers, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much may ſuffice to be ſpoken to the ſecond Enquiry, <hi>How</hi> we are to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi> our Charity to the proper Objects of it, in what <hi>Manner,</hi> and in what <hi>Meaſure?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I proceed to what remains to be done according to the propos'd Method, I think it will not be amiſs to enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Expreſſes of our Charity to the <hi>ſick,</hi> Danger of <hi>infection</hi> will not excuſe from viſiting them?</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, <hi>firſt</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> that Danger of Infection will not excuſe <hi>all</hi> from viſiting the ſick: For 'twould be ſtrangely <hi>inhumane,</hi> and contrary to this Chriſtian Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Compaſſion which we are now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of, to deſert a poor helpleſs Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his <hi>greateſt Neceſſity,</hi> only becauſe there is a Probability of falling into the like Calamity: And would any Man be willing to be ſerv'd ſo himſelf? <hi>Some</hi> then ought, even in Caſe of <hi>Contagion,</hi> to viſit and attend the ſick; but <hi>who</hi> are they, for every one will be ready to ſhift it from himſelf?</p>
            <pb n="255" facs="tcp:103289:139"/>
            <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, I think the neareſt <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the Party ought to do it, for they have a <hi>double</hi> Tye upon them, that of <hi>Nature</hi> as well as of Religion; and among theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, thoſe that are the moſt diſengag'd from <hi>Buſineſs</hi> and the Affairs of this World, and have therefore the leaſt Obligation to come into other Company where there may be Danger of ſpreading the Infection further; and likewiſe ſuch as have the feweſt <hi>Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> upon them: That is, <hi>Private</hi> and <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi> Perſons are oblig'd to this Duty before thoſe that are of more publick Callings, and have Families; and among theſe, he that is <hi>moſt</hi> free and diſengag'd, and capable withal, is the <hi>moſt</hi> oblig'd. If there be no <hi>Relations</hi> of the infected Perſon (whether he be Poor or Rich, Friend or Enemy, Good or Bad, the Caſe is the ſame) or none that will venture upon ſuch hazardous Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; I think the neareſt Neighbours are oblig'd to do it; <hi>i.e.</hi> the <hi>ſingle,</hi> and diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd from a Neceſſity of <hi>publick Converſe:</hi> For thoſe that have Wife and Children and Families, their Charity muſt begin at <hi>home,</hi> to take care of their <hi>own</hi> Relatives is the prime Obligation; and the Safety of a whole Family is in moſt Caſes to be preferr'd to that of a ſingle Perſon. And thoſe whoſe neceſſary Employments call them into <hi>much Company,</hi> are bound to avoid what would endanger their bringing <hi>Infection</hi> to that Company, and that for the ſame Reaſon as before, becauſe the Safety of <hi>many</hi> is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:103289:140"/>to be preferr'd to that of <hi>one:</hi> And thoſe upon whoſe Life depends, under God, the Maintenance and Support of divers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for the ſake of thoſe Perſons, ſhould be very careful to preſerve <hi>themſelves.</hi> On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this ought to be obſerv'd by ſuch as upon theſe and the like Accounts, cannot <hi>perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> viſit and attend the infected Perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That they take great care to procure <hi>others</hi> that may do it; and, according to their Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the Wants of the Perſon, to ſend Supplies of all things neceſſary. And there are very many, who, though they will not venture their Lives for <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſake, and to gain the Reward of being merciful in the other World, yet for <hi>Mony</hi> they will do it; and therefore ſuch Encouragements muſt not be wanting from thoſe that are of Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Phyſicians</hi> and <hi>Clergy-Men,</hi> whoſe Profeſſions engage them to converſe with great Numbers of People; how far they are oblig'd in this Matter, I think may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd thus:</p>
            <p>If <hi>only one</hi> Perſon in a Pariſh or Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, or but a <hi>few</hi> in compariſon with the whole <hi>Body</hi> of Men, be <hi>contagiouſly</hi> ſick; to me it ſeems, that neither Phyſician nor Divine are in ſuch caſe oblig'd perſonally to viſit them, but rather to <hi>forbear,</hi> and only to convey to them, by other Hands, what is needful for their Bodily and Ghoſtly Health reſpectively. The Reaſon is, becauſe the Phyſicians and Divines being often ſent for
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:103289:140"/>to divers Families, muſt either <hi>not</hi> go after they have viſited an infected Perſon, and ſo neglect their Duty, and <hi>many</hi> ſuffer, and ſome periſh for want of their Aſſiſtance; or, if they <hi>ſhould</hi> go, would very probably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the whole Neighbourhood: And therefore, the Safety of <hi>great Numbers</hi> of People being to be preferr'd before that of <hi>one</hi> or but a <hi>few,</hi> they ought, I think, in this Caſe to keep at diſtance.</p>
            <p>But when a Contagion ſpreads ſo that it becomes <hi>epidemical,</hi> and the <hi>greater</hi> Number of Perſons are ſeiz'd with it, then the Caſe is <hi>alter'd,</hi> and then I think both Phyſicians and Divines are bound to viſit <hi>perſonally.</hi> For in ſuch Caſe, to ſend Relief by <hi>other</hi> Hands, whether Medicines or ghoſtly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Advice; would, by reaſon of the Numbers of the ſick, become <hi>impracticable;</hi> and 'twould be unreaſonable for the ſake of a <hi>few</hi> that were well, to deprive a greater Number that are ſick of the great Benefit of perſonal Viſits of Phyſicians, which for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reaſons prove more effectual than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing at a <hi>Diſtance;</hi> and of the Comfort of the Prayers, and more cloſe and <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Diſcourſes of Divines, which no doubt are much more beneficial, and make a deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Impreſſion upon the Soul, than <hi>ſeveral</hi> Advices and Exhortations ſent in Writing.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Divines</hi> in this Caſe ſeem to be more oblig'd than <hi>Phyſicians</hi> (though the Obligation is very ſtrong upon Phyſicians too) and that becauſe the Safety of the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:103289:141"/>
               <hi>Soul</hi> is infinitely to be preferr'd before that of the <hi>Body,</hi> And if it periſhes it periſhes for <hi>ever,</hi> and will at length involve the Body too in the ſame eternal Ruin. And, for a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd to <hi>deſert</hi> his Flock in their <hi>greateſt Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,</hi> to <hi>leave</hi> the Care of their Souls when there is the greateſt Need of his <hi>Help,</hi> and the infernal Lyon roaring about ſeeking whom he may devour: This, I think, is the greateſt <hi>Barbarity,</hi> and moſt baſe betraying that great Truſt, that is poſſible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The good Shepherd,</hi> ſays our Lord, <hi>giveth his Life for his Sheep:</hi> And <hi>he,</hi> the great Shepherd, and Biſhop of our Souls, ſet the Example; <hi>but the Hireling fleeth becauſe he is a Hireling, and careth not for the Sheep, and the Wolf catcheth and ſcatters and devours them,</hi> John 10.12, 13. We ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that God is infinitely <hi>powerful,</hi> and can protect, even from the noiſom Peſtilence, if he thinks fit; and nothing more intitles a Man to the peculiar Protection of the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, than a faithful Diſcharge of his Duty. And, however it may fare with us <hi>here,</hi> there is a glorious Recompence reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for ſo great a Charity in a <hi>better</hi> World.</p>
            <p>Proceed we now to the <hi>third</hi> and laſt thing to be done upon this Subject, which is to ſhew, what great <hi>Encouragement</hi> we have to this excellent Duty of Charity, or what a Bleſſedneſs it is to be able thus to <hi>give,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to <hi>Receive;</hi> and that both with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>this</hi> World and that to <hi>come.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="259" facs="tcp:103289:141"/>
            <p>For, in the firſt place, with Relation to this World, What can be a greater Pleaſure to a Generous Spirit, than to be the Happy Inſtrument of reſcuing others from <hi>Miſery</hi> and <hi>Want,</hi> from periſhing with <hi>Hunger,</hi> or by other Calamities, and reſtoring 'em to Life and Comfort, and Health and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? What Delight more high and noble, than that which will ariſe from our changing the <hi>Sighs,</hi> and <hi>Groans,</hi> and <hi>Laments</hi> of the Miſerable, into <hi>Rejoycings;</hi> and the <hi>Curſes</hi> and horrid <hi>Blaſphemies,</hi> and impious Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon Providence, utter'd by thoſe whom Extremity of Poverty has made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate; into <hi>Praiſes</hi> and <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of God, and Acknowledgments of his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> and Care of the Children of Men?</p>

            <p>And indeed, every Expreſſion of Mercy and Compaſſion reſembles us to <hi>God,</hi> whoſe <hi>Mercy is above all his Works;</hi> and to the Compaſſionate Jeſus, who ſo pitied the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Eſtate of Mankind, as to leave his Father's Glories, and take on him the Form of a Servant, and ſuffer in our ſtead, that we might be Partakers of Life and Pardon, and Immortal Happineſs, and <hi>who went about doing Good</hi> all the Days of his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            <p>But Secondly, (and which, with ſome may be the moſt prevailing Argument) there is great Encouragement to Charity, with Relation to <hi>this</hi> World, becauſe 'tis the moſt <hi>thriving</hi> of all Chriſtian Graces, and is always attended with <hi>Proſperity,</hi> and a Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> ſays expreſly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.25. <hi>I have been Young, and now am Old, and yet ſaw,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:103289:142"/>never the Righteous forſaken, nor his Seed beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Bread, i. e.</hi> as it follows in the next Verſe, the Righteous Man that is <hi>ever merciful and lendeth:</hi> And not only <hi>himſelf,</hi> but his <hi>Poſterity</hi> is bleſſed. And this, a learned Author of our own,
<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> Pract. Cat. Lib. 3. Sect. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Extends to all Ages, and challenges any Hiſtorian of Paſt, or Obſervator of preſent Times to give one Inſtance of any Chriſtian Alms Giver, that ever brought himſelf or his Poſterity to</hi> Want, <hi>nay, that did not</hi> thrive <hi>and proſper the better by that means.</hi> And this is confirm'd by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> Prov. 11.24, 25. <hi>There is that ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and yet increaſeth, and there is that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth more than is meet, and it tendeth to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty: The Liberal Soul ſhall be made fat, and he that watereth ſhall be water'd alſo himſelf.</hi> That is, as the ſame Author has it, <hi>unleſs by Negligence or Suretiſhip, or ſome other</hi> Sin <hi>that he lives in, he brings a Curſe and Poverty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, and Mercifulneſs prove not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote ſufficient againſt all other Poiſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he that is thus aſſur'd of the peculiar Care of God concerning him, and that he ſhall always have a comfortable Proviſion as long as he lives, in Recompence of his libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Charity to the Poor and Needy; has queſtionleſs very great Encouragement to perform the Duty. And as for the unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Troubles of this Life which will mix with the moſt perfect Proſperity <hi>here,</hi> as Sickneſs, Vexation and Diſappointments, and Temporal Loſſes, and ſuch like;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 41.1, 3.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord will deliver him that conſidereth the

            </p>
            <p>As for the Encouragement to this Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with Reſpect to the <hi>next</hi> World, it is thus expreſs'd by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Bleſſed are the merciful for they ſhall obtain Mercy;</hi> that is, at the Time when every Man will ſtand in the greateſt Need of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the Day of Judgment. For then there will be particular Enquiry made into the Diſcharge of every one's Stewardſhip, in Point of Mercy and Compaſſion to the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and Calamitous; and the great Judge of all the World, has declar'd, that when he ſhall come in the Clouds of Heaven, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to every Man according to his Works; he will eſteem the Expreſſes of our Charity to his neceſſitous Servants as done to himſelf, and will reward the Merciful, not only with a <hi>publick Commendation,</hi> at that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly of all the World, but will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them to a Participation of the Glories and Felicities of his Eternal Kingdom: Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Come ye Bleſſed Children of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepar'd for you from the Beginning of the World,</hi> Mat. 25.34. And ſurely no Man can want Encouragement to the Duty when it ſhall be rewarded in ſuch a Manner as this.</p>
            <pb n="263" facs="tcp:103289:143"/>
            <p>I ſhall now infer ſome few things from the whole, and ſo conclude this Argument. And firſt, from the ſtrict Charge that God has given, in the Revelations of his Will, to every capable Perſon, to ſupply the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of <hi>all</hi> that want Relief, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Wants</hi> of the Needy, and in a Meaſure ſuitable to his <hi>Ability,</hi> and inforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Charge with the moſt prevailing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that can be made uſe of. From hence I infer the great <hi>Unreaſonableneſs,</hi> as well as <hi>Impiety,</hi> of charging <hi>God</hi> with the Miſeries of Mankind in this Inſtance.</p>
            <p>For, what would they have God do more in this Matter than he has already done? Would they have him exerciſe his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in <hi>wholly preventing</hi> Poverty? That is, would they have him interpoſe in all the Contingencies of this Mortal Life, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately <hi>command</hi> the <hi>Sea,</hi> for Example, to be <hi>calm,</hi> when a Veſſel is in Danger, whoſe Wreck would be the <hi>undoing</hi> of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; or ſend an Angel to ſteer her from Shelves and Quickſands, to preſerve her from Pirates, and conduct her in Salety to the Haven? Would they have the <hi>Land</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly ſecur'd from all Misfortunes too, from the Villanies of Men, from Caſual <hi>Fires,</hi> from <hi>Inundations</hi> and <hi>Earthquakes;</hi> and would they have Men <hi>forcibly</hi> with-held from being guilty of ſuch <hi>Vices</hi> as ruin Thouſands, ſuch as Pride and Luxury, and Wantonneſs and Exceſs?</p>
            <pb n="264" facs="tcp:103289:144"/>
            <p>Or if (as well they may) they think <hi>this</hi> too unreaſonable to be deſir'd, would they have God, when Men are thus <hi>reduc'd to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,</hi> immediately work <hi>Miracles</hi> for their <hi>Relief?</hi> Would they have <hi>Ravens</hi> bring Food to the Hungry as they did to <hi>Elijah;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 17.6.</note> or would they have <hi>every</hi> Poor Widows Cruiſe of Oyl, and Barrel of Meal be as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting as the Widow's of <hi>Sarepta</hi> was;
<note place="margin">— 16.</note> or would they have Water ſpring from <hi>Rocks,</hi> and be immediately turn'd into <hi>Wine,</hi> to chear and refreſh ſuch as are parch'd with Thirſt? Would they have our <hi>Lord</hi> come down a <hi>ſecond</hi> Time from <hi>Heaven,</hi> to heal <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> or an <hi>Angel</hi> always ſet open the <hi>Priſon</hi> Doors when good Men are confined and macerated, or the like?</p>
            <p>That ſuch extraordinary things have been <hi>ſometimes</hi> done, is ſufficient to evince, that God is not an <hi>idle Spectator</hi> of Humane Affairs; but to expect it ſhould be <hi>always</hi> ſo, is fooliſhly preſumptuous.</p>
            <p>But, it may be, thoſe that are aſham'd of <hi>this,</hi> would yet, by all means, have God take a <hi>ſeverer</hi> Courſe with his unfaithful Stewards than he does; and at leaſt <hi>diſplace</hi> them, and <hi>give their Riches to others, that Men might ſee and fear, and do no more wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly.</hi> Thus <hi>Man will be replying againſt God, and the Clay ſaying to the Potter, Why haſt thou made me thus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, I would fain know, whether theſe Counſellours of the All-wiſe God, would have <hi>all</hi> that are unfaithful in their Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:103289:144"/>us'd in this Manner, or only <hi>ſome</hi> for a Terrour to the reſt? If <hi>all</hi> the World would quickly be in <hi>Confuſion,</hi> by ſuch frequent Changes in States and Governments, and Private Families, as would then be made; if <hi>ſome</hi> only, <hi>in Terrorem,</hi> and to affright the reſt into a more Conſcientious Diſcharge of their Duty, why that is <hi>often</hi> done; nothing is more common than the Riſe and Fall of Men and Families, and ſometimes their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay is made very remarkable by ſome <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> Accidents. Which, if Men would obſerve it, is warning enough to them to be faithful in their Stewardſhip: but if they will be thoughtleſs and regard it <hi>not,</hi> the Blame ought to be <hi>their</hi>'s, not <hi>God</hi>'s, and their's will be the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> too at the long Run, when he ſhall call every Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him to make up his Accounts.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, let no Man any more, for the future, paſs Impious and Raſh Cenſures upon the <hi>All-wiſe</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> Governour of the Univerſe, becauſe his <hi>Servants</hi> neglect their Duty in this Matter; but rather, humbly and earneſtly intreat him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline their Hearts to a better Obſervance of his Holy and Juſt, and Merciful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. And if the Poor ſhall ſtill go unpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied and unreliev'd, let us commit their Cauſe unto <hi>him,</hi> who, if with Patience they perſevere in well-doing, will at length abundantly recompence their Sufferings <hi>here,</hi> with Glory, Honour and Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <pb n="266" facs="tcp:103289:145"/>
            <p>Secondly, From what has been ſaid, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, the great Baſeneſs and <hi>Ingratitude</hi> of thoſe who thus wickedly betray their Truſt, and thereby bring ſuch Odious <hi>Aſperſions</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their great <hi>Benefactor,</hi> and ſo much <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> upon Mankind.</p>
            <p>Good God! That ever Men ſhould be ſo low ſunk, ſo vilely brutiſh and degenerate, as to prefer a Shining Coach and Gay Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's, and Vanity and profuſe Folly in many other Inſtances, before the Honour of their God, and the Comfort and Reward of a Poor Afflicted Chriſtian! That they ſhould be contented to hear the Groans of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, and the Blaſphemies of Atheiſts, againſt that God who gave them all they have; rather than by <hi>retrenching</hi> any thing from their <hi>Exceſſive</hi> Way of Living, to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence either! 'Tis a Monſtrous <hi>Complicated</hi> Impiety this, and will at laſt pull down a Heavy Vengeance.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, from the whole, I infer, in the laſt place, how highly it concerns us all to imitate the Example of the <hi>diſcreetly</hi> and <hi>thoroughly</hi> charitabe <hi>Samaritan</hi> in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and be more careful of this our Duty for the future. For if we prove <hi>ill</hi> Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of the Talents God has committed to our Truſt for the Relief of the Calamities of our Brethren, we ſhall not only have the Sins of <hi>Unfaithfulneſs</hi> and baſe <hi>Ingratitude</hi> to anſwer for; but the Prophane Flouts and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of the Atheiſtical, the Curſes and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations of the deſperately Miſerable, the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:103289:145"/>Thefts and Murthers, and other Villanies of ſuch, whoſe <hi>Unrelieved</hi> Poverty forced to be thus wicked; and the Blood of ſuch as <hi>dy'd</hi> for want of Succour: <hi>All this</hi> will be charg'd upon us, and overwhelm us with Eternal Horrour and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, to conclude; <hi>while we have Time, let us do good unto all Men, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to thoſe of the Houſhold of Faith;</hi> let us <hi>make Friends with the Mammon of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> that when all <hi>this</hi> World's Good ſhall <hi>fail</hi> us, <hi>we may be receiv'd into Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Habitations.</hi> Let us <hi>lay up for our ſelves a good Foundation againſt the Time to come,</hi> and be Faithful Stewards of <hi>the manifold Grace of God</hi> committed to us; leſt our great Lord ſhould come in a Time when we think not of him, and place us on the Left Hand, and paſs this Diſmal and Irreverſible Sentence upon us; <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into Everlaſting Fire, prepar'd for the Devil and his Angels. For I was Hungry and ye gave me no Meat, Thirſty and ye gave me no Drink, a Stranger and ye took me not in, Naked and ye cloathed me not, Sick and in Priſon, and ye viſited me not.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>From which terrible Condemnation, and that hardned Diſpoſition that deſerves it, and will inevitably bring it down upon us if not ſpeedily amended, the Merciful and Good Lord deliver us all, for the Sake of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> Amen, Amen.</q>

               <p>O Moſt Compaſſionate Jeſus! The great Pattern of Charity, who in the Days of thy Fleſh wenteſt about doing Good to Mankind, relieving the Neceſſities both of Body and Soul, and haſt commanded thy Diſciples to go and do likewiſe; give me the Grace, I beſeech thee, according to my Ability, to be charitable to all that are real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Neceſſitous, without excepting any, but always to guide theſe good Works with Diſcretion: Leſt by my ill-plac'd Alms, I encourage Debauchery and Sloth, and have the leſs to give to thoſe that truly want. And ſince the Poverty and Sickneſs of the Soul, is of all, the moſt dangerous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable, O that I may be ſo happy, as by Fraternal Correption, and Seaſonable wholſom Counſel and Advice, according to my Opportunities and Capacity, to relieve the Spiritual Neceſſities of my Brethren, and convert a Sinner from the Errour of his Way, and ſave a Soul from Death! And may I always <hi>chearfully</hi> perform this Godlike Duty, and take Delight in being Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in the Bleſſed Work of chearing the Hearts of the Diſtreſſed, and making light the Burthens of the Afflicted, and thereby vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating thy Providence from the Vile Aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Wicked Men, and occaſioning much Thankſgiving unto God. O may I never forget that I am the Steward only of that Portion of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:103289:146"/>this World's Good, with which thou haſt intruſted me, for the Good of thy great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: And that thou wilt one Day call me to give an Account of the Diſcharge of this my Stewardſhip, particularly enquire into my Acts of Charity, and infinitely reward me if I be found Faithful in this Truſt, and for ever puniſh me with the Devil and his Angels if I be not. And that I may abound the more in this excellent Grace of Charity: Aſſiſt me effectually and immediately to cut off all Exceſſes and vain Superfluities of Life, and never let me be ſo forſaken of all Piety and Humanity, as to ſuffer my poor Fellow-Servants to want Neceſſaries, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than retrench my vile Extravagancies! May this moſt excellent and royal Law of thine be always preſent with me as my Rule, to do to others as I would be done by in like Circumſtance; and in all the Expreſſes of my Charity, let thy Glory, and the Good of my Brethren and the Public, be my ſole End; and remove far from me all Pride and Vain-Glory, for thy Mercies Sake. This and whatever elſe is neceſſary to the Perfection of this great Duty, grant me, I beſeech thee, O moſt Compaſſionate Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>After a long time, the Lord of theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Interpretation</hi> of this Parable may be this. By <hi>a Man travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into a far Country,</hi> is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented our Saviour's leaving this World, and Aſcending into Heaven after he had finiſh'd the great Work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; and by his <hi>calling to him his own Servants, and delivering to them his Goods,</hi> is ſignified his enabling his Diſciples with ſufficient <hi>Grace</hi> and the Aſſiſtance of his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> to perform that Duty and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which he requires of them in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>

He that by the previous Gift of God in his <hi>natural</hi> Endowments, is capable of doing him great Service, and of being an excellent <hi>Example</hi> to others; and is therefore by the Providence of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for, or actually plac'd in an <hi>eminent Station,</hi> and employ'd in a Service of great Weight and <hi>Difficulty;</hi> to him is given <hi>greater</hi> Aid from Above, becauſe he is more capable of <hi>improving</hi> what he receives to God's <hi>Glory</hi> and the Good of the <hi>Church;</hi> and has likewiſe greater <hi>Need</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance, by reaſon of the <hi>Difficulty</hi> of the Duty he is to perform. And he that <hi>naturally</hi> is <hi>not</hi> ſo capable, receives propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably <hi>leſs</hi> Aid from Heaven; but yet ſuch as is ſufficient to enable him to diſcharge <hi>that Duty</hi> which, according to his <hi>natural Capacity,</hi> is required of him.</p>
            <p>By <hi>His Trading</hi> that had received <hi>Five</hi> Talents, and gaining <hi>other Five,</hi> and his gaining <hi>other Two</hi> that had <hi>received</hi> but <hi>Two;</hi> is ſhewn, that according to the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of Grace and <hi>ſupernatural</hi> Aſſiſtance that Men have received, ſo ſhould their <hi>Improvement</hi> be, and that <hi>faithful</hi> Chriſtians will be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to <hi>make</hi> ſuch Improvement: And by <hi>His</hi> hiding his Talent in the Ground that had but <hi>One,</hi> is repreſented the inexcuſable
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:103289:149"/>
               <hi>Sloth</hi> and Idleneſs of wicked Men, who will not take ſo much Pains as to improve, tho but <hi>One</hi> Talent, in order to their Salvation.</p>
            <p>By the Lord of thoſe Servants <hi>coming after a long time and reckoning with them,</hi> is repreſented the Coming of Chriſt to <hi>Judgment</hi> at the <hi>End of the World,</hi> then to enquire into every Man's Works, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or Puniſh as there is juſt Occaſion.</p>
            <p>By His receiving the <hi>Diligent</hi> into his <hi>Joy,</hi> is expreſs'd the Reward of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the Bliſsful Kingdom of Heaven; and by the <hi>Slothful</hi> and <hi>Wicked</hi> Servant, (who was therefore <hi>Wicked</hi> becauſe <hi>Sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>) by his bringing his <hi>One</hi> Talent to his Lord <hi>unimprov'd,</hi> and excuſing his Unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſs by ſaying, that he <hi>knew him to be a hard Man,</hi> unreaſonably <hi>griping,</hi> expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>reap where he had not ſown,</hi> and the like; and that therefore he brought him his own again as he gave it him, fearing to employ it, leſt he ſhould have loſt it, and yet been oblig'd to make it good to his Lord: By this is repreſented the <hi>Baſe</hi> Thoughts too many have of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> as if it were impoſſible to bear his Yoke, and keep his Commands, he exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch <hi>unreaſonable</hi> Services from us; but this is only to excuſe <hi>one</hi> Wickedneſs by <hi>another,</hi> and ſhews what wretched Shifts Ill Men are put to, to palliate their great Neglect of their Duty to their Maſter; as appears by his Lord's anſwering and ſaying, <hi>Thou wicked and ſlothful Servant, thou kneweſt
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:103289:149"/>that I reap where I ſowed not, thou oughteſt therefore to have put my Money to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers, that at my coming I might have receiv'd my own with Uſury:</hi> By which is repreſented the Neceſſity of Mens impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Talent for <hi>that very Reaſon</hi> (were it true) which they are apt to plead in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe</hi> for their ſlothful Negligence. For to him that looks upon God as ſo <hi>auſtere</hi> a Being, there is more than ordinary Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>improve</hi> what he has committed to his Truſt for that Purpoſe: And becauſe a Man eſteems God as an <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>ſevere</hi> Maſter, therefore to be idle and negligent in his Service, is a very <hi>prepoſterous</hi> Courſe, and looks as if he had a mind to provoke his Anger againſt him.</p>
            <p>But indeed, <hi>This</hi> is the <hi>Truth:</hi> God is ſo very far from being an <hi>unreaſonably ſevere Maſter,</hi> that He is <hi>a moſt indulgent Parent,</hi> and commands nothing but what is very practicable, and highly conducive to the Good and <hi>Happineſs</hi> of his Creatures; which ſhould create a <hi>Filial Love</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in us towards him, rather than a <hi>ſlaviſh Dread.</hi> But however, he is not ſo <hi>unreaſonably fond</hi> neither, as to paſs by the Provocations of obſtinate <hi>irreclaimable</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and clear thoſe that are <hi>Impenitent</hi> as well as <hi>Guilty,</hi> that have heinouſly <hi>offended</hi> him, and yet take no care to <hi>amend</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his Favour. Though <hi>he does not reap where he did not ſow, nor gather where he did not ſtrew,</hi> yet he expects a due Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:103289:150"/>of what he commits to our Charge, and is ready likewiſe proportionably to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our <hi>Induſtry.</hi> And this is apt indeed to <hi>quicken</hi> and <hi>encourage</hi> us in our Duty, but by no means to <hi>ſcare</hi> and affright us <hi>from</hi> it: For nothing can be more <hi>reaſonable,</hi> than for God to expect we ſhould <hi>improve</hi> what he beſtows upon us for <hi>that very end,</hi> and that we ſhould obey thoſe Commands of His which are ſo highly <hi>reaſonable</hi> in themſelves; and which he likewiſe <hi>aſſiſts</hi> us to <hi>perform.</hi> Let no Man therefore ſay, God is an unreaſonably <hi>rigid Maſter,</hi> and his Commands <hi>intolerable Burdens;</hi> for 'tis abominably <hi>falſe,</hi> (as will appear more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Sequel:) But were it <hi>true,</hi> it would be no Excuſe for Sloth and <hi>Idleneſs</hi> in his Service, much leſs for wholly <hi>deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it; but rather, an Argument for <hi>double</hi> Care and Diligence in it.</p>
            <p>By the Lord of that Slothful Servant commanding his <hi>One</hi> unimprov'd Talent to be taken from him, and given to him who by his Induſtry had improv'd his <hi>Five</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents to <hi>Ten;</hi> is repreſented God's <hi>depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> thoſe of his <hi>Grace</hi> and the Aſſiſtances of his Holy Spirit, who ſo much neglect it, and make no uſe of it to the great <hi>Enas</hi> for which it was given them, (viz.) <hi>His Glory</hi> and <hi>Their own Happineſs;</hi> and making ſtill greater <hi>Additions</hi> of his Grace to ſuch as have well improv'd their former Stock. And by his commanding the <hi>Unprofitable</hi> Servant to be caſt into <hi>Outer Darkneſs,</hi>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:103289:150"/>where ſhall be <hi>weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth;</hi> is expreſs'd their Deplorable Condition in the Regions of eternal Miſery and Deſpair, who make no Improvement of the Talents committed to them; the <hi>Deprivation of Grace</hi> in <hi>this</hi> World, being a certain Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of <hi>Perdition</hi> in the <hi>other.</hi> It nearly concerns therefore, every Man carefully to <hi>improve</hi> the Talent committed to him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>unto every one that hath ſhall be given, and he ſhall have Abundance, but from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away, even that which he hath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Parable, thus interpreted, affords us theſe <hi>Six</hi> Heads of Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God gives <hi>ſufficient Grace</hi> to every <hi>ſenſible Chriſtian</hi> wherewith to <hi>work out his Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That God expects from every Man, that he ſhould <hi>improve</hi> what Grace he has receiv'd, and that proportionably to the <hi>Meaſure</hi> in which it was given him, and make uſe of it to the <hi>Ends</hi> for which it was given.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That there will be a Time, when our Lord will come to take <hi>Account</hi> of Men's Improvement of the Grace that was given them, and reward every Man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his <hi>Deſerts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That there ſhall be <hi>Degrees</hi> of Men's <hi>Happineſs</hi> or Miſery in the other World, according to the <hi>Degrees</hi> of their <hi>Improvement</hi> or Negligence and Careleſſneſs in <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="278" facs="tcp:103289:151"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That 'tis abominably <hi>Falſe</hi> and <hi>Impious</hi> to charge God, as being unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>rigid</hi> and ſevere in <hi>taking</hi> this <hi>Account</hi> of Men's <hi>Improvement,</hi> and expecting to find a <hi>Good Uſe</hi> made of what he committed to their <hi>Truſt.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>Laſtly, That the Condition of the <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> will be unſpeakably <hi>happy,</hi> and that of the <hi>Unprofitable</hi> unſpeakably <hi>miſerable;</hi> and that both in <hi>this</hi> World and the <hi>next.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> God gives <hi>ſufficient Grace</hi> to every <hi>ſenſible Chriſtian,</hi> wherewith to <hi>work out his Salvation.</hi> I ſay to every <hi>ſenſible Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> becauſe I would confine my Diſcourſe to the State of ſuch as are <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and ſuch of <hi>them</hi> as have the <hi>Uſe</hi> of their <hi>Senſes</hi> and their <hi>Reaſon:</hi> For as for thoſe that are <hi>out of the Pale of Chriſt's Church,</hi> though Charity will incline us to hope well of them, and that God's Mercy will extend even to <hi>Heathens</hi> that never yet <hi>heard</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> and his Spirit aſſiſt them to live according to that <hi>Natural</hi> Law written in the Heart of every Man; yet we can <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> nothing in this Caſe with Relation to them, and have nothing elſe to do, but to leave them to the <hi>Infinite Mercy</hi> of God, and <hi>pray</hi> for their <hi>Converſion.</hi> And as for ſuch as have been receiv'd into the <hi>Fold of Chriſt,</hi> and have afterwards prov'd <hi>Idiots,</hi> and without the Uſe of their <hi>Reaſon,</hi> their Caſe is likewiſe wholly in the <hi>Dark</hi> to us; and though we need not queſtion, but God's Infinite Goodneſs, will incline him to <hi>pity</hi>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:103289:151"/>their Deplorable Condition, yet which <hi>Way</hi> he will expreſs his Mercy to them we muſt not preſume to ſay. <hi>Hidden</hi> things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to <hi>God;</hi> the <hi>reveal'd</hi> are for <hi>us and our Children:</hi> Among which I take this to be <hi>one,</hi> That <hi>God gives ſufficient Grace to every ſenſible Chriſtian, wherewith to work out his Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here not to enter into the <hi>Endleſs</hi> and moſt <hi>Abſtruſe</hi> Diſpute about <hi>Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (which the leſs Men trouble their Heads about, the better 'tis for 'em in all Reſpects) I ſhall only urge two or three <hi>plain Places of Scripture</hi> to confirm this Poſition, and add to 'em <hi>one as plain Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> are firſt, that in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. where the Apoſtle ſays, that <hi>God is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance;</hi> to which is agreeable that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 2.4. <hi>God will have,</hi> or deſires, that <hi>all Men ſhould be ſav'd, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth;</hi> Now, the next Scripture I will quote, which is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. tells us, That <hi>we are not ſufficient of our ſelves, to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our Sufficiency is of God;</hi> and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>'tis God that worketh in us, to will and to do of his good Pleaſure;</hi> and accordingly, ſays <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> ſpeaking of our Lord, <hi>of his Fulneſs have we all receiv'd, and Grace for Grace, John</hi> 1.16. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.7. <hi>To every one of us is given Grace according to the Meaſure of the Gift of Chriſt.</hi> Which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures put together make this Argument.</p>
            <pb n="280" facs="tcp:103289:152"/>
            <p>God is deſirous of the Happineſs and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>every</hi> Man;
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.9. 1 Tim. 2.4. 2 Cor. 3.5. Phil. 2.13.</note> but, without his <hi>Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> and the Aids of his <hi>Grace,</hi> and Holy Spirit, <hi>no</hi> Man can <hi>arrive</hi> at that Happineſs:</p>
            <p>Therefore,
<note place="margin">Joh. 1.16. Epheſ. 4.7.</note> he gives <hi>ſufficient Grace</hi> and Aſſiſtance to <hi>every Man,</hi> wherewith, if he be not <hi>Idle</hi> and Wanting to himſelf, he <hi>may work out his Salvation.</hi> For, we can't but allow, that what God <hi>deſires</hi> for <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man,</hi> and which <hi>no Man</hi> can <hi>attain</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his <hi>Aid</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſtance,</hi> he will give <hi>every Man</hi> ſufficient <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> with his own Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Concurrence to <hi>compaſs.</hi> Otherwiſe, he would <hi>deſire</hi> that for <hi>ſome, i. e.</hi> thoſe to whom he ſhould deny his Divine Aſſiſtance, which he knows 'tis impoſſible for them to attain to; which I think can't be conſiſtent with his Infinite <hi>Wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſeems to me to be ſufficient <hi>Scripture</hi> Proof for this Poſition. And to this I ſhall add this one <hi>Plain Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, becauſe the <hi>Commands</hi> of Religion, in order to the attaining the <hi>Rewards</hi> of it, are given in <hi>General,</hi> to <hi>every Man,</hi> and there is no <hi>Exception</hi> made, but <hi>every one that names the Name of Chriſt muſt depart from all Iniquity;</hi> therefore, <hi>every Man</hi> muſt be ſuppos'd <hi>able</hi> to keep and <hi>obſerve</hi> thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, unleſs we will be ſo Blaſphemous as to ſay with the Unprofitable Servant in the Parable, that God is ſo <hi>unreaſonable</hi> as to <hi>reap where he did not ſow,</hi> to command <hi>Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities;</hi> and then ſo <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>cruel,</hi> as to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Men Eternally for <hi>not obeying</hi> them.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:103289:152"/>But now, that no Man is of <hi>himſelf</hi> able to keep the Commandments, is evident from the whole Tenor of Scripture, and from the ſad Experience of even the <hi>Beſt</hi> of Men; and conſequently, this Ability muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to proceed from the Aid of ſome <hi>other,</hi> namely, from him who is the <hi>only Giver of every good and perfect Gift, and who giveth to every Man liberally, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth not.</hi> Indeed, he giveth to every Man <hi>ſeverally as he pleaſes,</hi> to ſome <hi>more,</hi> to ſome <hi>leſs,</hi> to ſome <hi>five</hi> Talents, to ſome <hi>two,</hi> and to others but <hi>one;</hi> according to Men's Ability to improve them, and as in his Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom he ſees moſt conducive to his <hi>own Glory,</hi> and the <hi>Edification</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> but he is wholly <hi>wanting</hi> in this Divine Gift to no Man that is capable of improving it, but beſtows upon every ſenſible Chriſtian, <hi>Grace ſufficient,</hi> wherewith if he makes <hi>good Uſe</hi> of it, <hi>to work out his Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this ſhould have this fourfold good Effect upon us. It ſhould make us unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly <hi>thankful</hi> to the Infinite Goodneſs of God, for this his unſpeakable Gift; look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the <hi>Grace</hi> he hath beſtow'd on us, as an Earneſt of our Salvation. It ſhould put us upon begging devoutly and earneſtly and frequently at the Throne of Grace, for ſtill <hi>greater</hi> Degrees of this <hi>Heavenly Aid,</hi> in order to his <hi>greater Glory,</hi> and our more <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Happineſs;</hi> remembring that this is of all the greateſt Treaſure; and what a <hi>Frail</hi> Sinful Creature, ſhould above all things hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:103289:153"/>and thirſt after. For though every Man at firſt, receives as much Grace as he is able to improve; yet he that has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd what he at firſt receiv'd, is by that his Diligence grown capable of more, and able to make a ſuitable Improvement: As he in the Parable that had improv'd his Five Talents to Ten, was capable of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and Improving ſtill <hi>more;</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly had his Talent given to him who buried it in the Ground, and brought it without any Improvement to his Lord. Five Talents was at firſt proportionable to his Ability, but by duely improving them, his Ability was much enlarg'd, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came capable of, and received more. And to God ſhould all the <hi>Praiſe</hi> be given, of all the good Things we perform by means of this his Divine Aſſiſtance; reflecting upon the Words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.7. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ, and what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive?</hi> And finally, becauſe to <hi>all of us</hi> is given <hi>Grace ſufficient</hi> to our Happineſs; therefore <hi>to work out</hi> our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it in <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>trembling,</hi> leſt by our Negligence and Sloth we <hi>fail</hi> of this Grace of God, and it be withdrawn and taken from us.</p>
            <p>For in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Place, God expects that every Man ſhould <hi>improve</hi> the <hi>Grace</hi> he hath receiv'd, and that proportionably to the <hi>meaſure</hi> in which he has receiv'd it, and make uſe of it to the <hi>Ends</hi> for which it was beſtow'd upon him.</p>
            <pb n="283" facs="tcp:103289:153"/>
            <p>For thus we ſee in the Parable, how <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry</hi> the Lord was when his Servant brought him the Talent he committed to him, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improv'd;</hi> he calls him <hi>ſlothful and wicked Servant,</hi> and deprives him of his Talent, and gives it for an Encouragement, to him that had made the <hi>greateſt Improvement,</hi> and ſentences the Unprofitable Servant to <hi>outer Darkneſs, where is weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> And agreeably ſays St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>The manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every one to profit withal.</hi> Chriſtianity is not an idle lazy Profeſſion, does not conſiſt in fine Words and ſpecious Pretences, but in an active lively Piety, ſuitable to every Man's ſeveral Ability. He that has recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>much Grace</hi> muſt be eminent for <hi>much Holineſs;</hi> his Piety muſt ariſe proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Communications of the Holy Spirit which he enjoys, and his <hi>Diligence</hi> be commenſurate to his <hi>Strength.</hi> He that has received <hi>five Talents,</hi> muſt gain <hi>other five</hi> with them; and he that has receiv'd <hi>two, other two;</hi> and no Man muſt be without <hi>ſome</hi> Increaſe, though he has receiv'd but <hi>One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>End</hi> for which God beſtows his Grace upon us, is <hi>threefold.</hi> (1) For the <hi>Advancement</hi> of his <hi>own Glory;</hi> (2) For the Good and <hi>Edification</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> (3) For our <hi>own</hi> Happineſs and <hi>Salvation.</hi> And therefore, the more Grace and Aſſiſtances from Above a Man has receiv'd, the more ſhould he endeavour to <hi>glorifie God</hi> with it,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:103289:154"/>to <hi>edifie</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and by a holy Life, to ſecure his <hi>own Salvation.</hi> And he that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes <hi>no</hi> uſe of the Grace that God hath given him, like him in the Parable, who inſtead of <hi>trading</hi> with his Talent, hid it in the Earth; or elſe <hi>abuſes</hi> it to <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>wicked</hi> Purpoſes; is a <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable</hi> Servant, and ſhall be caſt into <hi>outer Darkneſs.</hi>

            <p>To know <hi>when</hi> a Man has receiv'd <hi>plenty</hi> of this Divine <hi>Grace,</hi> and to what <hi>Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> he is conſequently oblig'd; is, for him in the firſt place to reflect upon his <hi>natural</hi> Parts and Abilities, upon his Capacity for <hi>underſtanding</hi> and conſidering the great <hi>Truths of Religion;</hi> and then, what <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> he hath met with in the School of Righteouſneſs; what plenty of Religious Diſcourſes and Exhortations he has enjoy'd; and how frequently he has felt Motions from <hi>within</hi> to a ſtill more and more holy and exemplary Life: He that hath experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd all this in a <hi>great</hi> degree, that hath had his pregnant <hi>natural</hi> Capacity well cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated by an early and excellent <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> and had the whole of Religion plainly laid before him in all the <hi>Doctrines, Duties, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments</hi> of it; and been often and affectionately exhorted to live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in all holy Converſation and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and has frequently felt ſecret <hi>internal</hi> Motions and Perſwaſions to it; this Man has received much more than <hi>One</hi> Talent at the hands of God, and God will expect
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:103289:154"/>from him a <hi>proportionable Improvement;</hi> and he muſt <hi>abound</hi> in every good Word and Work: <hi>For unto whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall be much requir'd; and to whom Men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.</hi> But becauſe all Men are not of equal Abilities <hi>naturally,</hi> neither have the <hi>ſame</hi> Opportunities of <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, nor the ſame <hi>immediate Impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> of the Bleſſed Spirit; where there is any <hi>defect</hi> in theſe Reſpects, God will <hi>abate</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably in his <hi>Expectations;</hi> and he that received the <hi>One</hi> Talent, had he gained but <hi>One other</hi> with it, would have been call'd a <hi>good and faithful Servant,</hi> and been receiv'd into the <hi>Joy</hi> of his Lord.</p>
            <p>Let us all therefore, endeavour to <hi>grow</hi> in <hi>Grace</hi> according to the <hi>meaſure</hi> of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Gift; to perform our Duties, each in his <hi>Station,</hi> and according to his <hi>Ability,</hi> faithfully and induſtriouſly; that when our Lord comes to make Enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to each ones Improvement of his Talent, and call for every ones particular Account, we may all, from the leaſt to the greateſt, chearfully give it up, and receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Reward of a ſincere Diligence: For,</p>
            <p>In the third Place, There will moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be a Time when our Great Lord will come to take Account of every Man's <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement</hi> of the Grace that was given him, and <hi>reward</hi> every Man according to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving.</p>
            <pb n="286" facs="tcp:103289:155"/>
            <p>That there will certainly be a Day of Judgment both of Quick and Dead, when every Man ſhall be rewarded <hi>according to that he hath done in the Body, whether it be good or evil,</hi> is a Truth ſo evident from Scripture, that thoſe who have read, and do believe <hi>thoſe</hi> Writings, can make no doubt of it: And the Proof of this from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> has been ſo convincingly manag'd by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Learned Pens, particularly of late by Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> in his Excellent Diſcourſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Judgment, that I think nothing can be added to it; I ſhall only therefore Collect ſuch a Deſcription of that Great Day, and the Proceedings in it, out of the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> (where it is the moſt movingly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented) as may incline us all with the greateſt <hi>Diligence,</hi> and <hi>immediately,</hi> by <hi>ſelf-Examination</hi> and Amendment of every evil Way, to prepare for that great Audit, that we may give up our Accounts <hi>with joy, and not with grief.</hi> In the 20th Chapter of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> ver. 12. after the divine Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had given a Deſcription of the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the great Judge upon his Throne, <hi>I ſaw a great White Throne,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and him that ſat on it; from whoſe face the Earth and the Heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them:</hi> He proceeds, <hi>I ſaw the dead, ſmall and great, ſtand before God, and the Books were opened. And another Book was opened, which is the Book of Life; and the dead were judged out of thoſe Things that were written in the Books, according to their Works;
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:103289:155"/>and the Sea gave up the dead that were in it, and Death and the Grave deliver'd up the dead which were in them; and they were judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every man according to their Works: And whoſoever was not written in the Book of Life, was caſt into the Lake of Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, The Records ſhall then be laid open wherein every Man's Receipt of Grace is enter'd, and thoſe whoſe Works ſhall be found <hi>proportionably good</hi> according to the <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> they have receiv'd from <hi>Above;</hi> or, in the Stile of the Parable; that have made an anſwerable Improvement to the Number of Talents committed to them, their Names ſhall be written in the Book of Life, and they received into the eternal Joy of their Lord. But thoſe who can then give no good Account of their Talents, ſhew no ſuitable Improvement in Holineſs according to the meaſure of Grace they have received, ſhall never ſee Life, but be <hi>caſt into the Lake of Fire, which is the ſecond Death.</hi> And becauſe ſo very few will be ſo <hi>wiſe,</hi> as to make due Preparation for this great Day of Account, by improving the Grace God has given them to the great Ends for which it was deſign'd; therefore, as 'tis deſcrib'd <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.15. <hi>The Kings of the Earth, and the great Men, and the rich Men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty Men, and every Bond-man, and every Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> many of all Qualities and Conditions, from the higheſt to the loweſt; <hi>ſhall hide themſelves in Dens, in Rocks, and Mountains,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:103289:156"/>and ſay to the Rocks and Mountains, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb; for the great Day of his Wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand!</hi> May theſe Terrors of the Lord perſwade us to provide <hi>in this our day, for the Things that belong to our Peace, before they be hid from our eyes! looking for,</hi> by frequent Meditation, and haſtning unto, by a diligent Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Talents, <hi>the coming of this dreadful day of God;</hi> and being above all things careful, <hi>That we be found of him in Peace, without ſpot and blameleſs; for God will bring every ſecret Thing into Judgment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or evil,</hi> and exactly adapt every Man's Recompenſe to his Work. Which brings me to the next Thing I am to conſider in this Parable; namely,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That, at that great Day of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, when every Man's Work is fully known, and his <hi>Improvement</hi> compar'd with what he has <hi>receiv'd;</hi> the Diligent ſhall not only in general be receiv'd into the Joy of their Lord, and the unprofitable caſt into outer Darkneſs; but the <hi>moſt</hi> Diligent, thoſe that have made the <hi>greateſt</hi> Improvement, ſhall receive the <hi>greateſt ſhare</hi> of Happineſs: And thoſe that have been <hi>moſt careleſs</hi> and Unprofitable, ſhall be doom'd to the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt miſery.</hi> That is, in ſhort, there will be <hi>degrees</hi> of Happineſs or Miſery reſpectively, awarded to Men according to the <hi>degrees</hi> of their Holineſs or Impiety.</p>
            <pb n="289" facs="tcp:103289:156"/>
            <p>I know this has been much queſtion'd by ſome, and wholly deny'd by others; and their main Reaſon againſt it I conceive to be this: That ſince the Happineſs of the <hi>Juſt</hi> in Heaven conſiſts in the <hi>Viſion of God,</hi> or the Excellencies and Beauties of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, which will fill a holy Soul with eternal and inexpreſſible <hi>Delight;</hi> for ſo St. <hi>John</hi> expreſſes the Bliſs of Heaven, by <hi>ſeeing God as he is,</hi> 1 Joh 3.2. and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by <hi>ſeeing him face to face, and knowing him even as we are known,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.12. And ſince the Miſery of the <hi>Wicked in Hell</hi> conſiſts in an eternal <hi>Baniſhment</hi> from his Divine Preſence; for ſo the Sentence runs that ſhall be paſs'd upon them at the Day of Judgment, <hi>Depart from me ye Curſed,</hi> &amp;c. Upon theſe Accounts it ſeems to them moſt agreeable to Truth, that <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Juſt,</hi> being admitted to the <hi>Beatifick Viſion of God,</hi> ſhould be <hi>equally Happy,</hi> and <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Wicked</hi> being for ever <hi>exil'd to him,</hi> ſhould be <hi>equally Miſerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Argument, in my Apprehenſion, is ſo far from <hi>deſtroying</hi> the Doctrine of the Degrees of Happineſs and Miſery in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Hell, that I think 'tis rather the beſt <hi>Supporter</hi> of it. For, ſince 'tis very true, that the Happineſs of Heaven conſiſts in the <hi>Beatifick Viſion of God,</hi> and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of Hell in an eternal <hi>Baniſhment</hi> from him; and ſince 'tis as true, that <hi>ſome</hi> good Men in <hi>this</hi> Life, approach nearer to him, and ſee more of his Excellencies, and bear
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:103289:157"/>a greater Reſemblance to him than <hi>others,</hi> and ſo become <hi>capable</hi> of a more <hi>intimate</hi> Viſion of him in Heaven; and <hi>ſome</hi> bad Men, on the contrary, wander to a <hi>greater diſtance</hi> from him <hi>here,</hi> and become <hi>more unlike</hi> him by their <hi>great</hi> Impieties than other Sinners do; and ſo become more <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable</hi> of that <hi>pure</hi> and holy Viſion, than others that are <hi>leſs</hi> wicked: Since this is ſo, methinks it ſhould be moſt agreeable to Truth, that thoſe that were the <hi>Holieſt Men</hi> here, ſhould be the <hi>Happieſt Saints</hi> in Heaven, as bearing a nearer Reſemblance to the Divine Nature, and conſequently capable of a more <hi>cloſe</hi> and intimate Viſion of him; and that thoſe who by their great Impiety beyond other Men, were <hi>moſt eſtranged</hi> from God here, ſhould be baniſh'd <hi>fartheſt</hi> from him in the Regions of Deſpair and Darkneſs, as being the <hi>moſt hateful</hi> to him, becauſe the <hi>moſt unlike,</hi> nay <hi>contrary</hi> to him, and the <hi>moſt uncapable</hi> of ſeeing and enjoying him; and conſequently feel the <hi>moſt exquiſite</hi> Pangs of Horror and Deſpair, the <hi>hotteſt</hi> Boilings of Rage and Impatience, and <hi>moſt bitter</hi> Remorſe of Soul, for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>moſt miſerable</hi> Condition upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; when <hi>once</hi> they might with much Eaſe and Pleaſure have avoided it, and been for ever <hi>happy</hi> in the <hi>Viſion and Enjoyment of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, as to plain Proof from <hi>Scripture</hi> of the <hi>Degrees of Miſery in Hell,</hi> I muſt confeſs I cannot recollect any, and would
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:103289:157"/>by no means <hi>ſtrain</hi> God's Word beyond its due Extent; but as to Degrees of <hi>Glory and Happineſs</hi> in Heaven, I think there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places of Scripture that plainly enough eſtabliſh that Doctrine; of which I ſhall mention but one, and that becauſe 'tis part of a Parable exactly the ſame in the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed ſenſe</hi> of it, with that I am now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing upon, only ſomething differently related by S. <hi>Luke.</hi> 'Tis in the 19th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the 15th and 4 following Verſes; where we find, when the King came to take Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Servants Improvement of what he left in their Hands to trade with in his Abſence, he exactly proportion'd every Man's <hi>Recompenſe</hi> to the <hi>Increaſe</hi> he made of what was committed to his Charge; to him that had gain'd <hi>Ten</hi> Pounds, with the Pound his Lord left with him, was given Authority over as <hi>many</hi> Cities; and ſo to him that had gain'd <hi>Five,</hi> proportionably Authority over <hi>Five:</hi> Which I think can mean no leſs than this, that where there is different Degrees of Mens Improvement of <hi>Grace</hi> in <hi>this</hi> World, there ſhall be as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Degrees awarded of <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> in <hi>Heaven;</hi> and there being great Difference between the Degrees of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>Improvement</hi> here, there will be as great Difference in the Degrees of their <hi>Happineſs</hi> hereafter. And though every Saint in Heaven ſhall have as clear and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Viſion and Enjoyment of God as he is <hi>capable</hi> of, and partake in an agreeable
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:103289:158"/>Meaſure of the <hi>Happineſs</hi> that will flow from ſuch Viſion and Enjoyment, and be as Happy as 'tis poſſible for him to be; yet the <hi>Capacity</hi> of every Saint will not be <hi>equal:</hi> Some Souls will be more enlarg'd than others, and able to receive more Rays of the Divine Glory; and ſo, though every of thoſe Veſſels of Honor ſhall be <hi>full,</hi> yet all will not <hi>hold alike;</hi> and one Star <hi>there,</hi> will differ from another Star in Glory.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, indeed, that the Mind of <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> good Man ſhall then be clarified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, purg'd from the Droſs and Soil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted during its Reſidence in the Fleſh, and rendred more agile and expedite in the Exerciſe of its ſeveral Faculties, and its Knowledge and Love of God vaſtly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: But that Souls of <hi>leſs</hi> Improvement here, ſhall immediately upon their Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Body, receive <hi>extraordinary new Additions,</hi> to equalize them to thoſe of <hi>higher</hi> Attainments, is hard to imagine; and would mightily diſcourage the generous Endeavours of <hi>Heroick</hi> Piety and <hi>Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary</hi> Religion. But, when every Man ſhall in that glorious Kingdom above, be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the Degrees of his Piety; and a <hi>great</hi> Love to God, and <hi>zealous</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Intereſt of Religion, and an <hi>eminent</hi> Sanctity, ſhall be crown'd with a <hi>more</hi> than <hi>ordinary Glory</hi> and Felicity in <hi>Heaven,</hi> 'twill mightily encourage a holy Soul to <hi>forget,</hi> with St. <hi>Paul, the things that are behind, and preſs on to what is ſtill before,</hi>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:103289:158"/>always aiming at ſtill greater Degrees of <hi>Perfection,</hi> till Mortality ſhall be <hi>ſwallow'd up of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Improvement of this <hi>Speculation</hi> to <hi>Practice</hi> is this; That ſince the Degrees of Glory and Happineſs in Heaven, ſhall be anſwerable to the Degrees of Mens Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Improvement of their Talents upon Earth; we would run with <hi>Diligence</hi> the Race that is ſet before us, and gird up the Loins of our Mind, and ſet our ſelves to the Performance of every thing that is well-pleaſing in the ſight of God with <hi>Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs;</hi> and not pretend <hi>Difficulty,</hi> when the Reward is ſo exceeding great, and ſhall be proportion'd to the Degrees of our Vertue. For can we be <hi>too happy?</hi> Can we be <hi>too like God?</hi> Can our Crown be too glorious and reſplendent? Away then with that mean-ſpirited Religion which thus leſſens and <hi>confines</hi> our Happineſs; let us unfold our Hands, and pluck them out of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, and encourage our ſelves in a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Purſuit of an <hi>excellent Piety; foraſmuch as we know, that our Labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In the next Place, I am to ſhew, that 'tis abominably <hi>falſe and impious,</hi> with the Unprofitable Servant in the Parable, to charge God with being <hi>unreaſonably rigid</hi> and <hi>ſevere,</hi> in taking ſo ſtrict an Account of Mens <hi>Improvement</hi> of his Divine <hi>Grace</hi> and Aſſiſtances, and expecting to find a good Uſe made of what he committed to their Truſt.</p>
            <pb n="294" facs="tcp:103289:159"/>
            <p>That God is often charg'd with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable <hi>Severity,</hi> by Men that care not to perform their Duty, is too true to be queſtion'd; and ſuch as love to indulge their vile Affections, and cannot afford to take any pains to be Religious, are frequently heard to ſay, They ſerve God as well as they <hi>can,</hi> and they can do no more; and that <hi>ſuch</hi> a Religion as <hi>we</hi> urge Men to, is much too hard for Fleſh and Blood: 'Tis a Law fitter for Angels than Men; and tho they <hi>wiſh</hi> they could obſerve and do it, and can't but <hi>conſent to the Excellency of it in the Inner Man,</hi> yet they find a <hi>Law in their Members warring againſt the Law of their Minds, and bringing them into Captivity to the Law of Sin;</hi> and ſo, <hi>the good that they would they do not, and the evil that they would not that they do</hi> And they take up with this as a <hi>ſufficient Excuſe;</hi> and becauſe God is infinitely <hi>merciful</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> they think he will accept the Plea of the great <hi>Hardſhip</hi> of his Commands, and their <hi>Inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> to perform them, inſtead of Obedience to them. But, (as the Lord in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſaid to his ſlothful Unprofitable Servant) Out of their own Mouths will I judge thoſe wretched Perſons, that thus mock and abuſe God, and deceive their own Souls into Ruin. For, if God be infinitely <hi>good</hi> and <hi>merciful,</hi> then certainly, he will not expect any Thing from Men beyond their <hi>Ability,</hi> nor command their Service and Obedience any farther than they are able to pay it:
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:103289:159"/>And conſequently, what this <hi>merciful</hi> and <hi>good</hi> God commands by <hi>All</hi> Men to be done without any Exception or Diſpenſation, and threatens Eternal Miſery to ſuch as ſhall dare wilfully to <hi>diſobey</hi> him; this, <hi>Every</hi> Man, no queſtion, is able to perform, through the Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance; which, as I have before prov'd, is in ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient meaſure given to every Man. And to <hi>deny</hi> this, is, in effect, to charge God with the greateſt <hi>Cruelty, Oppreſſion,</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice</hi> that is poſſible. For what leſs, is the giving Men ſuch Commands as they are not <hi>able</hi> to <hi>perform,</hi> and withal threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and actually <hi>inflicting, unconceivable</hi> Torments (for ſuch are thoſe of <hi>Hell</hi>) upon all that ſhall be found diſobedient to the <hi>impracticable</hi> Law? This would be, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to require Brick without Straw, as the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Task-maſters did, and then to lay on Stripes for a Failure in the Work; nay, 'twould be infinitely <hi>worſe,</hi> becauſe the Puniſhment for Irreligion, and not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Talents, is infinitely <hi>greater,</hi> and ſhall be inflicted to all <hi>Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since therefore, God knows whereof we are made, and remembers that we are but Duſt, and can tell how difficult his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands will be to us, and how proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able our <hi>Ability</hi> is to keep and do them, better than we our ſelves, (for 'tis <hi>he</hi> that hath made us, and gave us our <hi>natural</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Faculties, and the Superadditions of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Aid</hi> from Above;) ſince he is
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:103289:160"/>infinitely <hi>good,</hi> and will not <hi>overload</hi> his Creatures, nor exact <hi>impoſſible</hi> Tasks, or ſuch as are <hi>extremely difficult,</hi> and but one degree <hi>below</hi> impoſſible; ſince he is likewiſe infinitely <hi>juſt,</hi> and will not <hi>damn</hi> Myriads of poor Wretches to all Eternity, for not making an <hi>impoſſible</hi> Improvement of their Talents; and expects only that they ſhould give a <hi>reaſonable</hi> Account, according to what they have received from him: From all this it will follow, Not that therefore a Man ſhall be excus'd for pleading <hi>Inability,</hi> but, that every Man is <hi>Able,</hi> through the never deficient Grace of that good God to ſuch as heedfully attend to it, to <hi>keep</hi> his holy, juſt, and good Commands, and make <hi>Improvement</hi> ſuitable to the Talents he hath receiv'd; and if, for all this, he periſh, his Blood will be upon his own Head.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, let no Man, for the future, be ſo Impious, as to charge God with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting <hi>impoſſible</hi> Services from his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or think to palliate his Irreligion by crying out of the extreme <hi>Hardſhip</hi> of living like a Chriſtian; but let every Man ſet heartily and ſincerely about his Duty, and he will find, that God's <hi>Grace</hi> will be <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> for him to his daily Improvement, and that the Ways of Religion are <hi>ways of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and all her paths are peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to the <hi>laſt</hi> Thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd in this Parable; which is, That the Condition of the diligent <hi>Improvers</hi> of their Talents will be unſpeakably <hi>happy,</hi> but the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:103289:160"/>Condition of the <hi>Unprofitable,</hi> beyond Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion <hi>miſerable;</hi> and that, both in <hi>this</hi> World and in the <hi>next.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, The Condition of the diligent <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers</hi> of their Talent, will be unſpeakably <hi>happy,</hi> both in <hi>this</hi> World and <hi>that</hi> above. In <hi>this</hi> World, a quiet and ſerene Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will be to them a <hi>continual Feaſt;</hi> the Senſe of having perform'd their Duty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their <hi>Ability,</hi> of having been good Stewards of the Grace of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon them, and that they can give a <hi>ſincere</hi> Account, though not a <hi>perfect</hi> one, to their great Maſter, when he ſhall come to look into their Behaviour in their Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip; this, will fill their Breaſts with unſpeakable Satisfaction, their Soul will be <hi>calm,</hi> and their Thoughts at Reſt in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of their <hi>Fidelity,</hi> their Life not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter'd with anxious Fear and Dread of a ſad <hi>After</hi> Reckoning; but, like that of a faithful Servant who is in his Maſter's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, ſteady and eaſie, and moving cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the Circle of his Duty, and in joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Expectation of the Reward of his Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, when his great Lord ſhall advance him from the State of a <hi>Servant</hi> to that of a <hi>Friend</hi> and Boſom-<hi>Favourite;</hi> nay, of a Coheir with himſelf of the Joys and Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of the Eternal Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>And beſides this Serenity and Satisfaction of Mind, and comfortable Proſpect of ſo glorious a Recompenſe of Reward, (which are Bleſſings of the firſt Magnitude, and to
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:103289:161"/>which, nothing in <hi>this</hi> World is <hi>comparable</hi>) the <hi>improving</hi> Chriſtian ſhall have <hi>more Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents</hi> given him, more Grace ſhower'd down upon his Soul; what the <hi>Slothful</hi> have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, ſhall be conferr'd upon him, and he ſhall <hi>abound</hi> ſtill <hi>more and more</hi> in every good Word and Work. And what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition can approach nearer to the ſtate of <hi>Heavenly Glory,</hi> than that of a holy Soul thus <hi>plentifully</hi> ſtor'd with the <hi>divine Grace?</hi> And if <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> differ only in <hi>degree,</hi> and the One be but the Completion and Perfection of the other; a Soul ſo <hi>filled</hi> with Grace as the <hi>improving</hi> Soul will be, muſt needs live a <hi>Heaven upon Earth,</hi> and have frequent <hi>Antepaſts</hi> of <hi>Glory.</hi>

            <p>They ſhall be conducted (after having given a good Account of their Stewardſhip) by the Bleſſed Angels, into the Preſence of the great King of Heaven, where they ſhall <hi>ſee him face to face;</hi> and with <hi>wondring</hi> Eyes and <hi>enraviſh'd</hi> Hearts, behold his <hi>Glory,</hi> gaze upon his Splendors, and nearly view <hi>his</hi> Beauty, who is the <hi>Fountain of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

            <p>THIS Parable was ſpoken upon Occaſion of one of our Lord's Followers, deſiring him to Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate between him and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in a Difference about dividing their Patrimony; for ſo Verſe 13. of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>one of the Company ſaid unto him, Maſter, ſpeak unto my Brother, that he divide the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance with me.</hi> To this our Lord an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd in the 14. Verſe, <hi>Man, who made me a Judge or a Divider over you?</hi> And takes Occaſion from that Requeſt to him, rather to adviſe thoſe that were with him, and all that ſhould hereafter be his Diſciples, to <hi>take Heed and beware of Covetouſneſs,</hi> and that becauſe a <hi>Man's Life</hi> or Happineſs <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not in the Abundance of the Things which he poſſeſſeth;</hi> as 'tis in the 15. Verſe. And to make this his Excellent Advice ſink deeper into their Minds, he ſpake the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I am now to diſcourſe upon.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of it, as we ſee from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, is to draw Men off from <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> or a too eager Deſire of heaping up Riches; and to expoſe the great <hi>Folly</hi> of being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intent upon laying up Treaſures in <hi>this</hi>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:103289:166"/>Life, and taking little or no Care to be <hi>rich towards God.</hi> For, as that Rich Man in the Parable, whom God had bleſſed with an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> Increaſe of the Fruits of the Earth, even to more than his Barns could hold, did entertain Covetous Thoughts of building new ones to hoard it up in, and promis'd himſelf much Happineſs from that Abundance, <hi>Take thine Eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry, for thou haſt Goods laid up for many Years:</hi> As this Covetous Rich Man was ſurpriz'd with a ſudden Summons into the other World, and ſnatch'd away from the midſt of this Abundance, and upbraided with <hi>Folly,</hi> in truſting in ſuch <hi>uncertain</hi> Riches; ſo, and for the very ſame Reaſons, is every Covetous Rich Man an Egregious <hi>Fool,</hi> that <hi>confides</hi> in <hi>Wealth,</hi> and <hi>neglects Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my Diſcourſe, therefore, upon this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, I ſhall do theſe Four things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall give a ſhort <hi>Deſcription</hi> of the Vice of <hi>Covetouſneſs;</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Endeavour to <hi>expoſe,</hi> both the great <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Vileneſs</hi> of this Vice; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the Ill Conſequences that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I will anſwer the Rich Fool's Queſtion which he propos'd to himſelf upon the great Increaſe he had, <hi>What ſhall I do, becauſe I have no Room where to lay my Fruits?</hi> And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Shew the great <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of not ſetting our <hi>Hearts</hi> upon, nor <hi>eagerly</hi> purſuing
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:103289:166"/>Wealth, and of beſtowing it as Religion does direct, ſhould it pleaſe God in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Manner to bleſs us with it.</p>
            <p>And after all, I will urge this upon Men's <hi>Practice,</hi> and ſo conclude this Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am to give a ſhort <hi>Deſcription</hi> of the Vice of <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> that we may know what it is that this Parable would incline us to <hi>avoid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> this Parable warns againſt (for there are ſeveral Sorts of it) is an <hi>Immoderate</hi> Deſire of <hi>heaping</hi> up Riches, or of having ſtill <hi>more and more</hi> Wealth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have ſufficient for the <hi>Comfortable</hi> Support of our ſelves and Relatives; that we may for the Future, live in greater <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Luxury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, This Covetouſneſs is an <hi>Immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> Deſire of Riches; for <hi>all</hi> Deſire of Riches is not Criminal, and a Man may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lawfully <hi>deſire,</hi> and as lawfully, by all due Means, endeavour to procure <hi>ſo much</hi> Wealth as is needful for his own and his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi> Comfortable Maintenance, and will enable him to be kind to the Poor. But, to deſire even <hi>this</hi> with <hi>Impatience,</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great <hi>Solicitude,</hi> is the Sin of Covetouſneſs; and the Sin is very much <hi>aggravated</hi> when a Man greedily deſires ſtill <hi>on,</hi> when his Comfortable Subſiſtence, and ſufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for his Family is already provided for.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>immoderately</hi> to deſire to heap up Riches is <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> though we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> afterwards to <hi>enjoy</hi> them, to <hi>eat, and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:103289:167"/>drink, and be merry,</hi> and take our <hi>Eaſe</hi> the more, as the Rich Man in the Parable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to do; for this diſtinguiſhes <hi>Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> from extreme <hi>Parſimony</hi> and <hi>Niggardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> They <hi>agree</hi> indeed in this, that they are both an <hi>extreme Deſire of Riches,</hi> but they <hi>differ</hi> likewiſe in <hi>this,</hi> that the <hi>Covetous</hi> may eagerly deſire to <hi>get</hi> Riches with a Deſign af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards as prodigally to <hi>ſpend</hi> them, but the <hi>Niggard</hi> hoards up what he has got, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſcrape more to it with a Purpoſe not to make uſe of it <hi>himſelf,</hi> nor to let any body <hi>elſe</hi> touch it, as long as he can help it. And theſe, though they are <hi>both</hi> very <hi>great Vices,</hi> yet <hi>Niggardlineſs</hi> is, I think, by much the greater of the Two. But 'tis the extreme Deſire of heaping up Riches, tho' with a Purpoſe to <hi>enjoy</hi> them, that is the Vice this Parable is levell'd againſt; for the Rich Man <hi>there</hi> intended to inlarge his Barns, and lay up his Increaſe in them, <hi>that he might take his eaſe, and eat, and drink, and be merry;</hi> which is a <hi>Kind</hi> of <hi>Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> that though very <hi>many</hi> are <hi>guilty</hi> of, yet few think it deſerves to be call'd by that hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Name.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more to be explain'd in this Deſcription of Covetouſneſs, namely, What is meant by ſuch a Proportion of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es as is ſufficient for the <hi>Comfortable</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of a Man and his Relatives? And the Anſwer to this muſt be in <hi>General;</hi> (for to <hi>Particularize</hi> in this Caſe would be endleſs) <hi>that</hi> is ſufficient for the Comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:103289:167"/>Subſiſtence of every Man and his Family, which will ſecure them, according to their <hi>Station</hi> and <hi>Degree,</hi> from <hi>Want;</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Plenty of what is neceſſary to <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>health,</hi> and <hi>decency,</hi> though it does not ariſe to the <hi>Pomps</hi> and <hi>Vanities</hi> of the World: For he that hath <hi>this,</hi> has, no queſtion, what is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for a very comfortable Subſiſtence to any <hi>Reaſonable</hi> Man. And he that is not ſatisfied with <hi>ſuch</hi> a Degree of Wealth as <hi>this,</hi> will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſatisfied with <hi>any,</hi> be it never ſo <hi>great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He therefore, that at <hi>all</hi> deſires Riches <hi>impatiently,</hi> much more, he, that when he has a Reaſonable <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of Wealth, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vets ſtill <hi>more,</hi> that he may <hi>ingroſs</hi> it to <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> and the more indulge his <hi>Luxury,</hi> to the Neglect of better things, and builds his Hopes of <hi>Happineſs</hi> upon ſuch a Multitude of Riches; is guilty of the <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable was ſpoken againſt: And the <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Vileneſs</hi> of which Vice, I am in the <hi>Second</hi> Place to expoſe, and ſhew what very <hi>Ill</hi> Conſequences do attend it.</p>
            <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> All <hi>Immoderate Deſire</hi> of Riches, upon what Account ſoever, is a very great <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Immoderately</hi> to deſire <hi>any</hi> thing is queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a <hi>Folly;</hi> for <hi>all Immoderation</hi> is fooliſh and <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> as muſt be acknowledg'd by every Man at firſt ſight: And immoderate <hi>Deſire</hi> is a kind of <hi>Rack</hi> and <hi>Torture</hi> to the Mind, which for a Man in <hi>any</hi> Caſe to bring upon <hi>himſelf,</hi> is certainly a <hi>Folly,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>General,</hi> it muſt be allow'd to be a great Piece of <hi>Folly, immoderately to deſire
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:103289:168"/>Riches.</hi> But more <hi>Particularly</hi> it is ſo upon the following Accounts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe 'tis ſo very <hi>uncertain,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Man ſhall <hi>attain</hi> his Deſire, or no. There are ſo many <hi>croſs</hi> Accidents incident to the <hi>Purſuit</hi> of Riches, let Men take what Courſe they will, that 'tis generally the moſt <hi>precarious</hi> thing in the World. If a Man croſſes the <hi>Seas</hi> for Wealth, as <hi>uncertain</hi> as the <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>Waters</hi> are, as <hi>numerous</hi> as the <hi>Rocks</hi> and <hi>Quick-ſands,</hi> and <hi>Sea-Robbers;</hi> ſo great is the <hi>Uncertainty,</hi> whether <hi>that</hi> way he ſhall <hi>have</hi> what he <hi>deſires,</hi> and <hi>heap up Wealth,</hi> or no. If, for more <hi>Security</hi> he ſtays at <hi>Home,</hi> and by <hi>Domeſtick</hi> Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments endeavours to be <hi>rich;</hi> whatever his Employment is, he is not ſure he ſhall have <hi>Health</hi> to purſue it; or if he <hi>has,</hi> that his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours will be <hi>ſucceſsful;</hi> Ten Thouſand unforeſeen Accidents may deſtroy a very <hi>hopeful</hi> Beginning, and one <hi>Month</hi> may ſet him further <hi>back</hi> than he has <hi>advanc'd</hi> in <hi>Twenty Years;</hi> and <hi>one</hi> unlucky Hit may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to <hi>Poverty,</hi> after he has arriv'd <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt</hi> to the <hi>Completion</hi> of his Deſires. In <hi>other</hi> Caſes, there are ſome <hi>certain Means</hi> that ſeldom <hi>fail</hi> of their reſpective Ends; as <hi>Learning,</hi> where there is an <hi>Aptitude</hi> for it in <hi>Nature,</hi> may certainly be acquired by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Education, Diligent Study, and Good Converſation; and when there is a Natural <hi>Genius</hi> likewiſe, Men ſeldom fail by Good Inſtruction and <hi>Induſtrious Practice,</hi> of becoming Artiſts in their ſeveral Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:103289:168"/>But <hi>Riches</hi> do ebb and flow <hi>unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countably;</hi> ſometimes the greateſt <hi>Induſtry fails</hi> of them, and they fall <hi>unexpectedly</hi> upon the <hi>Idle</hi> and the Negligent; and as often, when Men think they are within their <hi>Reach,</hi> they make themſelves Wings and fly away they know not how. As, when a Child would catch a <hi>Graſs-hopper,</hi> its Motions are ſo very <hi>irregular,</hi> that he finds it a very difficult Matter at all to come <hi>near</hi> it; and when at length, after much Pains, he thinks he has gain'd his Prize, and eagerly puts forth his Hand to ſeize it, the nimble Inſect leaps to a further Diſtance from him than before. And even juſt ſo (how ruſtick ſoever the Compariſon may be) is it very often with Men that <hi>immoderately</hi> deſire, and <hi>eagerly purſue</hi> Riches; there's no <hi>regular</hi> Way of proceeding that a Man may ſecurely <hi>depend</hi> upon in the Caſe; The Ebbs and Flows of <hi>Wealth</hi> are as various and unaccountable as the Motions of that little <hi>Inſect,</hi> 'tis as hard a matter to come within <hi>reach</hi> of them, and men are as often baulk'd when they think they have them in their Poſſeſſion. And this can't but have been the <hi>Obſervation</hi> of <hi>every</hi> Man, that has liv'd any while in the World, and taken Notice of the Proceedings in it; and has been the coſtly <hi>Experience</hi> of very <hi>many.</hi> Now, for a Man <hi>immoderately</hi> to <hi>deſire,</hi> and <hi>impatiently</hi> to purſue, what there is no ſure and <hi>ſteady</hi> Way of <hi>attaining;</hi> and when, for any thing he can tell, after all his Pains, and the Uneaſineſs conſequent upon his eager

            </p>
            <p>And this Compariſon, as <hi>extravagant</hi> as it may ſeem, is countenanc'd by the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> of Men; who, in the 5th.

<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.17.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> warn Men, not to truſt in <hi>uncertain Riches,</hi> or the <hi>Uncertainty</hi> of Riches, which a Man is as uncertain of <hi>getting,</hi> as of <hi>keeping</hi> when he hath them. And to reaſſume the former Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as <hi>the Wind bloweth where it liſteth,</hi> and <hi>we hear the Sound of it, but cannot tell whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth;</hi> ſo <hi>unaccountable</hi> are
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:103289:169"/>the Motions of <hi>Wealth:</hi> For all any Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of ours, Wealth will take its own courſe and change maſters or <hi>ſervants</hi> rather as it liſteth; and though there is a great deal of <hi>Noiſe</hi> made with it and about it, yet no Man can certainly ſay <hi>whence</hi> it <hi>cometh,</hi> by what Methods he may be ſure to procure it, nor <hi>whither</hi> it <hi>goeth,</hi> by what Means 'tis loſt by one, and paſſeth another.</p>
            <p>And this is the <hi>firſt</hi> Reaſon why an <hi>immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate</hi> Deſire of <hi>Riches</hi> is a great <hi>Folly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis ſo ſtrangely <hi>uncertain</hi> whether a Man ſhall have that Deſire of his <hi>gratified</hi> or no, nay, a Thouſand to One that he ſhall <hi>not.</hi> A <hi>moderate</hi> Portion of this World's Good may be moderately deſir'd by a wiſe Man, becauſe there is no great Fear of his being <hi>diſappointed,</hi> and Induſtry is generally rewarded with a <hi>Comfortable</hi> Subſiſtence: but impatiently to thirſt after <hi>great</hi> Riches, is an Egregious <hi>Folly,</hi> becauſe 'tis great Odds, but 'twill be to <hi>no Purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> ſhould it be to <hi>ſome Purpoſe</hi> thus eagerly to deſire and endeavour after great Riches, and the Man <hi>gains</hi> what he would have; yet, after all, the Purchaſe is not <hi>great,</hi> nor will it countervail the Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the whole Man endures in the <hi>immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Deſire</hi> and earneſt Purſuit of it.

            <p>If abundance of Gold and Silver would certainly make a Man <hi>wiſer</hi> and <hi>better,</hi> if 'twould <hi>clear</hi> his <hi>Apprehenſion,</hi> or <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> his <hi>Memory,</hi> or improve his <hi>Reaſoning;</hi> if 'twould make him more prudent and <hi>diſcreet</hi> and of a <hi>riper Judgment;</hi> if 'twould increaſe <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and promote a <hi>Godlike</hi> Frame of Spirit; nay, if 'twould but ſo much as refine a Man's <hi>Temper,</hi> and make him of more ſweet and <hi>obliging Behaviour,</hi> or <hi>regulate</hi> the <hi>Paſſions</hi> and Affections of the Soul, and help him to Tranquility of Mind, and cure <hi>Anger,</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> and <hi>Luſt,</hi> and <hi>Revenge,</hi> or the like; if abundance of Riches would work any of <hi>theſe good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,</hi> 'twould be worth while earneſtly to deſire them, and induſtriouſly to endeavour to procure them: But, when 'tis ſo <hi>far</hi> from <hi>this,</hi> that the direct <hi>contrary</hi> is general obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in thoſe that have greateſt Riches in Poſſeſſion; it muſt, I think, be allow'd to be a very great Piece of <hi>Folly,</hi> for a Man to

            <p>But, though greedy <hi>Worldlings</hi> may own, that great Riches have little or no Influence upon the Happineſs and Improvement of the <hi>Inner Man;</hi> yet, becauſe a Man has a <hi>Body</hi> as well as a <hi>Soul</hi> to take care of, they are thus greatly deſirous of much Wealth, becauſe 'twill help them to the Enjoyment of much of <hi>this</hi> World's Happineſs, and acquire what will highly pleaſe and gratifie the <hi>Body;</hi> as the Rich Man in the Parable ſaid, they may take their <hi>eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry,</hi> when they have <hi>much Goods laid up for many Years.</hi> I ſhall therefore in the</p>

            <p>For beſides, that the Appetites of the Body are generally obſerved to be more ſickly and <hi>deprav'd</hi> in <hi>rich</hi> than <hi>poorer</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; their <hi>Sleep,</hi> worſe rather than better than other Mens;

               <hi>the Abundance of the Rich will not ſuffer him to ſleep,</hi> ſays <hi>Solomon, but the Sleep of the Labouring Man is ſweet, eat he little or eat he much;</hi> and that <hi>Health</hi> is much more a Stranger to the <hi>Rich</hi> than to the <hi>Meaner</hi> ſort, and the Pleaſures of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Body Vigorous and Active, without the Encumbrance of Weakneſs and Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, almoſt engroſs'd by the Labouring Poor; Beſides this, (which yet alone is enough to prove, that 'tis a <hi>folly</hi> to expect even this
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:103289:171"/>World's Happineſs from Abundance of Riches, for without <hi>Health,</hi> which Luxury deſtroys the moſt of any thing, there is no Taſte or Reliſh in any other of its Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;) there is this One Reaſon more, among others, that will farther, and I think <hi>evidently</hi> prove, that 'tis a very great Folly to expect to be <hi>happier</hi> even in <hi>this</hi> World, by growing Richer; and it is this, That Riches are of all Things the moſt <hi>unſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and the moſt <hi>perplexing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Other</hi> Good Things of this World do in ſome ſort <hi>ſatisfie;</hi> and Men are often <hi>cloy'd</hi> with <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> have enough of Mirth and Jollity, of Recreations and Diverſions, and the like; and the Mind is, for a <hi>while,</hi> eas'd and refreſh'd by them: But as for <hi>Riches,</hi> as they <hi>increaſe,</hi> the Deſire of ſtill <hi>more, increaſes</hi> proportionably, nay, rather <hi>diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably</hi> with them; and 'twas never yet known, that a <hi>worldly-minded</hi> Man ever thought he had <hi>enough,</hi> but that his Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite grew <hi>keener</hi> after Wealth, the more 'twas fed with it: And 'tis not unuſual, to hear the greateſt Complaints, Murmurings, and Repinings from the <hi>richeſt</hi> Men. And as for the <hi>Perplexity</hi> that attends <hi>Abundance</hi> of Wealth, that likewiſe is as evident to common Obſervation. The more a Man <hi>hath,</hi> the more Care he muſt take to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> it, the more Quarrels and Law-Suits will he be embroil'd in; and when there are Troubles and Commotions in the State, and Times grow dangerous and uncertain,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:103289:171"/>then are the greateſt <hi>Worldlings</hi> fulleſt of Fears and dreadful Apprehenſions; and not only <hi>real,</hi> but <hi>imaginary</hi> Dangers, terrifie their Unman'd Souls; Things always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing with the worſt Aſpect to <hi>their</hi> troubled Fancies, who have made <hi>Gold</hi> their <hi>Deity,</hi> and ty'd up their Happineſs in their <hi>Bags.</hi> And nothing, certainly, can be more <hi>perplexing</hi> to a Man's Mind, than ſuch great Fears of <hi>loſing That,</hi> in the <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of which his <hi>whole Happineſs</hi> is <hi>concentred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And accordingly, <hi>Solomon,</hi> who had great Poſſeſſions, above All that were before him, and gather'd him Silver and Gold in ſuch Abundance, that Silver was in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> common as the Stones in the Street;
<note place="margin">1 Kings 10.27.</note> after all, ſays he, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.10, 11. <hi>He that loveth Silver ſhall not be ſatisfied with Silver, nor he that loveth Abundance with Increaſe. And what Good is there to the Owners there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſaving the beholding of it with their Eyes?</hi> And even the <hi>Eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing</hi> neither. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays very plainly, That the <hi>Love of Money is the Root of all Evil,</hi> and they that <hi>will be Rich, fall into Temptation and a Snare,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>and pierce themſelves through with divers Sorrows;</hi> and that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,</hi> with only <hi>Food and Raiment,</hi> is a far greater Happineſs. And therefore, good Reaſon had the Wiſeſt King to ſay, after all his Increaſe, and the Abundance he had <hi>amaſs'd</hi> together, that it was, not only <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> but <hi>Vexation of Spirit,</hi> Eccleſ. 2.11.</p>
            <pb n="318" facs="tcp:103289:172"/>
            <p>Now, that which can never <hi>ſatifie,</hi> and as it <hi>increaſes,</hi> increaſes a Man's Trouble and Perplexity (which is true, we ſee, of Riches) is, no doubt, far from conducing to a Man's <hi>Happineſs</hi> in <hi>this World;</hi> and therefore, 'tis a very great <hi>Folly,</hi> for any Man to depend upon Abundance of <hi>Wealth</hi> for <hi>Happineſs,</hi> for 'tis rather, the Cauſe of much <hi>Trouble</hi> and <hi>Diſquietude.</hi> Or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, God may ſuddenly deprive a rich <hi>Worldling</hi> of all he has by <hi>Death,</hi> and ſay, as in the Parable, <hi>Thou Fool, this Night ſhall thy Soul be required of thee, then whoſe ſhall thoſe Things be which thou haſt provided?</hi> For, <hi>As we brought nothing into the World, ſo 'tis certain we can carry nothing out.</hi> And thus much for the <hi>Folly</hi> of Immoderate Deſire of <hi>Riches,</hi> in Expectation of a <hi>Happy Life</hi> from <hi>Abundance.</hi> I proceed now to ſhew,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vileneſs</hi> of this ſort of Covetouſneſs, and of placing the Happineſs of Life in great ſtore of Wealth.</p>
            <p>That 'tis a very <hi>vile</hi> Thing for a Man immoderately to covet <hi>Riches,</hi> and place the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of his <hi>Life</hi> in <hi>Abundance</hi> of them, will be very evident, if we briefly conſider what a Man is, and what <hi>Abundance of Wealth</hi> is, and what little or no <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> the <hi>one</hi> bears to the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the <hi>other.</hi> A Man is a Creature endow'd with a <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Immortal</hi> Soul, capable of Knowing, Admiring, Loving, and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>God,</hi> who is the <hi>Supreme Good</hi> and the <hi>Centre</hi> of Felicity. As a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> he is
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:103289:172"/>an adopted Son of God, Coheir with Chriſt of a Crown of <hi>Glory</hi> in the Eternal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and deſign'd to participate of thoſe Rivers of divine Pleaſures that are at God's Right-hand for ever and ever. As for <hi>Riches</hi> (or Abundance of Gold and Silver, in which now-a-days we eſteem Riches chiefly to conſiſt) they are <hi>really</hi> no better than Heaps of <hi>Earth</hi> of different <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,</hi> impreſs'd with different <hi>Stamps,</hi> and made of different <hi>Sizes,</hi> and to which Men have given a different <hi>Value</hi> and Eſteem, according to their different <hi>Colour, Size,</hi> and <hi>Impreſſion;</hi> and which in themſelves, are good for little but to be <hi>look'd on,</hi> and which he that would <hi>live</hi> muſt part with when he has them, in Exchange for other Things that are neceſſary for his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, what can be more <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>baſe,</hi> than for ſo <hi>Noble</hi> and Excellent a Creature as Man, ſo far to <hi>degrade</hi> himſelf, as to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his greateſt <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Admiration,</hi> and <hi>Deſire,</hi> upon a Piece of <hi>Earth,</hi> which was originally made for him to <hi>tread</hi> upon, and produce Things for his Food and Pleaſure!

               <hi>Glories</hi> of <hi>Heaven;</hi> to place his <hi>Happineſs</hi> in what is ſo very much <hi>inferiour</hi> to him, and upon that which is <hi>indeed</hi> his <hi>Happineſs</hi> to beſtow no <hi>Thoughts;</hi> what can be more <hi>vile</hi> and abject than this! what more unbecoming the Dignity of the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Nature, and of a Creature that has ſuch <hi>glorious Hopes!</hi> Where is the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of a Man, that lays out all his Endeavours to acquire a <hi>Trifle,</hi> and in the mean time <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regards</hi> that which is his <hi>chief good?</hi> and where is the <hi>Religion</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that has been <hi>redeem'd,</hi> not by <hi>Corruptible Things, ſuch as Silver and Gold, but with the precious Blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh and without Spot;</hi> where is <hi>his</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that notwithſtanding this, makes <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> the chief Object of his <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> and <hi>treads under foot the Son of God, and counts the Blood of the Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was ſanctified, an unholy,</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>Thing, and does deſpight to the Spirit of Grace,</hi> and loves and admires <hi>Mammon</hi> more than his <hi>Saviour?</hi> What more <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>brutiſh</hi> than this, what more ſtupidly <hi>ungrateful!</hi> This is, to come down to a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel with the <hi>Beaſts that periſh;</hi> nay, 'tis to ſink much <hi>lower;</hi> for <hi>They</hi> act according to their <hi>Natural Inſtincts,</hi> and chooſe as they are <hi>directed</hi> by their Great <hi>Creator,</hi> and ſerve him obediently in that Rank of Being in which he has plac'd them: But <hi>that Man,</hi> much more <hi>that Chriſtian,</hi> that makes <hi>periſhing Riches</hi> the main Object of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires

And what can more <hi>vilifie</hi> and <hi>degrade</hi> a <hi>Reaſonable</hi> Soul, made after the <hi>Image</hi> of God, than ſuch baſe Affections as theſe? 'Tis certainly a moſt vile Degeneracy, and renders a Man the moſt <hi>contemptible</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Univerſe, both to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> and all <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>good Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much may ſuffice to expoſe the <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Vileneſs</hi> of an <hi>immoderate</hi> Deſire of <hi>Riches,</hi> as in <hi>them</hi> placing the <hi>Happineſs of Life.</hi> I ſhall now ſhew</p>
            <p>The ill Conſequences that attend it; which (beſides that great <hi>Perplexity</hi> of Mind they cauſe, mention'd before) are chiefly theſe <hi>two:</hi> (1) It mightily hinders a Man's <hi>Progreſs in Religion,</hi> which is the <hi>one Thing neceſſary.</hi> (2.)

Luk. 14.18</note> by which (as was diſcours'd upon that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) is repreſented the glad Tidings and Invitations of the Goſpel; he tells us, That <hi>that</hi> which <hi>detain'd</hi> Men from it, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Cares of the World</hi> and the <hi>Love of Riches;</hi> they had Ground to look after, and Oxen to prove, and therefore they could not come to the Wedding Supper. And accordingly, ſays our Saviour, in as <hi>expreſs</hi> Words as can be, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.24. <hi>No man can ſerve two Maſters, ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of this is twofold: For <hi>firſt,</hi> Nothing ſo much <hi>diſtracts</hi> a Man's <hi>Thoughts,</hi> as an eager Deſire and Purſuit of <hi>Wealth;</hi> for Riches are ſo difficult to be <hi>acquir'd</hi> (as has been ſaid) and ſo very <hi>ſlippery</hi> when gain'd; that, as to <hi>get</hi> them will exerciſe all a Man's <hi>Contrivance,</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all his Thoughts and <hi>Attention,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume his whole <hi>Time;</hi> ſo to <hi>keep</hi> them when once gotten, will, to a Man that knows the <hi>Hardſhip</hi> of getting them, and how <hi>ſoon</hi> they are <hi>loſt</hi> again, engage him in conſtant Care and Solicitude to <hi>watch</hi> his Idol, leſt he be <hi>depriv'd</hi> of it; and ſo, his Mind becomes diſtracted with continual Apprehenſions of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:103289:174"/>
               <hi>Danger,</hi> and at leiſure for no other Thoughts than how to <hi>ſecure</hi> his <hi>Riches.</hi> And this, thoſe that are acquainted with Men much wedded to the World, may ſoon perceive by their careful anxious Looks, and diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Timorous Diſcourſe. Now, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Love of Riches thus <hi>engroſſing a</hi> Man's Soul; and the great Buſineſs of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> or making Proviſion for <hi>Another</hi> World, and laying up a Treaſure of good Works in Heaven, being a Thing that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe requires <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Diligence,</hi> and a cloſe Application of all our Faculties to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it; and it being impoſſible for a Man to attend cloſely to two Things at once; and the Love of <hi>this</hi> World, and of the <hi>next,</hi> being not only <hi>different,</hi> but <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> the one to the other: How can it be, but that he that <hi>eagerly</hi> loves <hi>Riches,</hi> and has his Soul prepoſſeſs'd with a ſtrong De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of <hi>them,</hi> and all his Faculties before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in their Purſuit; muſt move very <hi>ſlowly</hi> in the Way of Religion, if he moves <hi>at all;</hi> nay indeed, rather move <hi>backward</hi> than <hi>forward;</hi> and the <hi>more</hi> he loves the <hi>World,</hi> grow colder ſtill in his Affections to <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Reaſon of this is, Becauſe an Immoderate Love of Money is a kind of <hi>Faſcination</hi> and Enchantment; it caſts a <hi>Miſt</hi> before a Man's Underſtanding, and makes him leſs ſenſible and <hi>apprehenſive</hi> of the great Obligation to a Religious Life, and ſo dulls and ſtupifies the Soul, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:103289:175"/>very little moved with the Sermons of the Goſpel. What elſe ſhould be the Reaſon of that ſtrange <hi>Unconcernedneſs</hi> in the Worldly-minded, though preſs'd never ſo home with the Neceſſity of minding Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion more and the World leſs, of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, before all Things, to be <hi>rich to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God,</hi> and to give of their Abundance to the Relief of the Poor, and not to truſt in <hi>uncertain</hi> Riches, and the like? They give us the Hearing perhaps, and that's All, and go on ſtill in their own Courſe as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly as ever; and if they offer any thing in their Defence, 'tis ſo ſtrangely <hi>weak</hi> that a Man can't but admire at it. Sometimes we ſhall hear them ſay, they don't know <hi>what Streights</hi> they may be reduc'd to yet before they dye, and therefore they think it but Prudence to provide for the worſt; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting all the while, that our Lord expreſly <hi>forbids</hi> all ſuch anxious Solicitude for the Morrow, and commands an humble Truſt in the Providence of God, who never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes thoſe that are moderately induſtrious, and depend upon him for a Bleſſing; and never reflecting upon the <hi>miſerable Streight</hi> they will be in at the Day of Judgment, if deſtitute of good Works, and not able to give a ſincere Account of their Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip.</p>
            <p>Sometimes theſe Men will quote Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and tell us, the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>He that provides not for his own Houſe, is worſe than an Infidel,</hi> forgetting in the mean time the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:103289:175"/>Words of the ſame Apoſtle in another Place, that <hi>the Love of Money is the root of all Evil;</hi> and thoſe of our Saviour imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before this Parable, <hi>Take heed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of Covetouſneſs, for a mans Life conſiſteth not in the Abundance of the Things which he poſſeſſeth.</hi> And in <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.32. <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs, and all theſe Things ſhall be added unto you, for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all theſe things;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.10. Eph. 5.5.</note> and that the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous</hi> are in the number of thoſe that ſhall never ſee the Kingdom of Heaven. Of all Vices that we reprove and warn Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Worldly-mindedneſs</hi> we find to be moſt <hi>ſtubborn</hi> and irreclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and 'tis very ſeldom indeed, that we can ſtop a Man that is in a hot purſuit of Wealth; ſo ſtrangely <hi>bewitching</hi> is this Love of Money, and more than ordinary deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of a true Senſe of Religion in the Soul. And accordingly ſays our Lord, <hi>How hard is it for a rich man</hi> (one that makes a <hi>God</hi> of Riches, and confides and truſts in them) <hi>to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven! 'tis eaſier for a Camel to paſs through the Eye of a Needle.</hi> 'Tis next door to an Impoſſibility, and nothing but the Almighty Power of God changing his Heart, can make him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of that Happineſs. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> agreeably, <hi>Not many rich, not many mighty are call'd, and the God of this World hath blinded the Eyes of thoſe that believe not.</hi> And the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> by the meer Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:103289:176"/>were ſenſible of this, and taught their Scholars a Separation from the Affairs of the World, if they would Philoſophize well, and find out pure Truth, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Wiſdom. Wherefore, we ſee it highly concerns us, to take no <hi>ſuch</hi> Thought for the Morrow, but endeavour to lay up a Treaſure in Heaven; becauſe, <hi>Where our Treaſure is, there will our Hearts be alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another very ſad Conſequence of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Love of Riches, is, that it expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a Man, more than any Thing beſides, to Apoſtacy, or falling from the Truth. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. ſays, <hi>They that will be rich, fall into Temptation and a Snare;</hi> and more expreſly in the next Verſe, <hi>The Love of Money is the root of all Evil; which, while ſome have coveted after, they have erred from the Faith:</hi> and the Event has often prov'd this true; and the Hopes of gaining, and the Fear of loſing Riches, has prevail'd with Thouſands to turn <hi>Apoſtates</hi> to the Truth. For the ſake of a little Money 'twas, that <hi>Judas</hi> betray'd his Maſter and Saviour; and to tempt with Money, is a way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure ſo very ſucceſsful, an Engine ſo almoſt irreſiſtable, that 'tis made uſe of by all ſorts that would gain Proſelites to a Party; and the great Tempter, with much Confidence, after his other Stratagems fail'd him, made Offer of <hi>Riches</hi> to our <hi>Lord Himſelf</hi> (as his beſt Reſerve) when he would perſwade him to Fall down and Worſhip him. And ſo unreaſonable a Love have Worldly-minded
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:103289:176"/>Men for Wealth, as to <hi>be</hi> and <hi>do</hi> any Thing at the Frowns or Promiſes of him who has Power to give or take away Riches. This has been the Experience of all former Ages, and too much of our <hi>own</hi> too, and will ſtill be ſo, till Men grow ſo wiſe as to know how to be content with Food and Raiment, and believe our Lord's Words, that <hi>a mans Life conſiſteth not in the Abundance of the Things which he poſſeſſeth,</hi> and <hi>that Godlineſs with Contentment, is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt gain.</hi> And therefore, as much as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Men to be <hi>conſtant</hi> in the Profeſſion of the Truth of God, that is, as much as their <hi>Salvation</hi> is worth, ſo much it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them to <hi>take heed and beware of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs.</hi> For 'tis very true, in more Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes than one, that it is <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Coloſ. 3.5.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſhewn, the great <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Vileneſs</hi> of an Immoderate Deſire of Riches, and of expecting the Happineſs even of <hi>this</hi> Life from Abundance of Wealth, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd two very ill <hi>Conſequences</hi> of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; I proceed now to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> Thing I intended to do; which is, to Anſwer the Rich Fool's Queſtion that he propoſed to himſelf, upon the great Increaſe he had, <hi>What ſhall I do becauſe I have no room where to lay my fruits?</hi> And ſhew, how many <hi>good</hi> Ways there are of Diſpoſing of <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all the Ways of beſtowing what was <hi>more than his Barns would hold</hi> (by which I ſuppoſe is expreſs'd his having more than
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:103289:177"/>was needful to his own comfortable Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) Covetouſneſs would let this Rich Man think of none but of Building <hi>New Barns</hi> wherein to <hi>lay up</hi> his Abundance, and then to <hi>take his Eaſe, and eat, and drink, and be merry:</hi> He looked no farther than <hi>Himſelf;</hi> and the more God's Bleſſings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd upon him, the more he purpos'd to live in Luxury and Exceſs, and <hi>Epicurize</hi> away that which God gave him to a quite different, and much better Purpoſe.</p>

            <p>For, every Man whom God has bleſſed with <hi>Abundance,</hi> is God's <hi>Steward</hi> of that <hi>Abundance,</hi> and muſt <hi>beſtow</hi> it according to the <hi>Will</hi> of his great <hi>Lord;</hi> for ſo St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>As every man has receiv'd the Gift, even ſo miniſter one to another, as good Stewards of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Grace of God.</hi> Now the Duty of a good Steward is thus repreſented in the 42d Verſe of this 12th of <hi>Luke, Who then is that faithful and wiſe Steward whom his Lord ſhall make Ruler over his Houſhold to give them their portion of Meat in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</hi> That is, To give the Family their Portion in due Seaſon, is the Duty of a
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:103289:177"/>Faithful and Good Steward. Now the Race of Mankind is God's great Family in the World, and ſome of the Members of this his Family he has made Choice of as his <hi>Stewards</hi> and <hi>Purveyors</hi> to provide for the reſt, and has according entruſted them with ſuch a ſhare of his Revenue, to ſome more, to ſome leſs, as in his infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he has thought moſt fit, and order'd them to expend it to the Advantage of his Houſhold, that every one be provided for according to his Needs, and that no Man be ſuffer'd, as much as in them lies, to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and periſh: And this he requires ſhould be done <hi>faithfully,</hi> after a moderate Proviſion firſt made for themſelves and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives, as they ſhall anſwer it at that great Audit, when every Man muſt give Account of his Stewardſhip.</p>
            <p>The Rich Man then in the Goſpel, being (as every other Rich Man is) God's <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> to provide for ſuch as were in Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and <hi>Want,</hi> according to the <hi>Abundance</hi> God had given him, 'tis an eaſie Matter to anſwer the Queſtion he propos'd to himſelf upon his great Increaſe, <hi>What ſhall I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have no room where to lay my fruits?</hi> Why, act like a <hi>good Steward</hi> for thy great Maſter, and let the Houſes of the Poor be the Granaries for the Abundance of thine Increaſe. <hi>Charity</hi> to the <hi>Neceſſitous</hi> is the beſt Way of beſtowing <hi>Abundance;</hi> and as many Ways as there are of expreſſing that Charity (which are innumerable) ſo many
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:103289:178"/>Ways are there of diſpoſing of what is more than needful for our own comfortable Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. To Feed the Hungry, to give Drink to the Thirſty, Harbour to diſtreſſed Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Cloaths to the Naked, Viſits of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Relief to the Sick, and Freedom to Priſoners; to be a Father to the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and a Husband to the Widow, and the like; this is to diſcharge a good Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip; this is what every Rich Man ought to do with his Abundance: And Bleſſed is that good Servant whom his Lord, when he cometh, ſhall find ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Of a truth,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>his Maſter will make him Ruler over all that he hath;</hi> he will commit ſtill more of his Reuenue to his Management, bleſs him with greater Proſperity and Increaſe, and at laſt he ſhall be received into the Joy of his Lord, and Reign with Chriſt his Great Maſter, in Glory for ever. Whoever therefore has <hi>Abundance,</hi> needs not much to perplex him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf how he ſhall beſtow it, for the <hi>Poor are always with us;</hi> and for the Relief of <hi>their Neceſſities,</hi> not the Gratifying our own <hi>Luxurious</hi> Deſires, muſt God's <hi>Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> Bleſſings be laid out.</p>
            <p>Let us now, in the <hi>Fourth</hi> Place, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of not ſetting our Hearts upon, nor eagerly purſuing Riches, and diſpoſing of them as Religion directs, if it ſhall pleaſe God in an extraordinary Manner to bleſs us with them.</p>
            <pb n="331" facs="tcp:103289:178"/>
            <p>
               <hi>If Riches increaſe, ſet not your Heart upon them,</hi> is excellent Advice of the Royal Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.10. and very true is that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, Epheſ.</hi> 1.6, 10. that <hi>while ſome have coveted after Mony, they have err'd from the Faith, and pierc'd themſelves through with divers Sorrows;</hi> and that Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with Content is great Gain; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wiſe indeed is that Man, that knows how to be content with his preſent Portion, and by ſetting his Affections upon more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Objects, eſcapes the <hi>Snare</hi> of coveting after Wealth. He is free from the moſt <hi>dangerous</hi> Paſſion, the Love of Mony being the <hi>root of all Evil;</hi> and is ſecure of Quiet and Satisfaction amidſt all the Turns and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of Fortune, the great Uncertainties of a falſe and fickle World: If <hi>Poverty</hi> ſhould become his Lot, he is <hi>prepar'd</hi> for't; he knows there is no Stability in this World's Good, and therefore values it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and remembers that he has a much greater Treaſure in a better Place, of which none can deprive him, and which he ſhall enjoy to <hi>Eternity,</hi> and upon <hi>that</hi> fixes his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and longs for the Happy Time when he ſhall take <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of it. While he hath a plentiful Fortune, he acts like a good Steward of his great Lord, and enjoys the Comforts of it by letting thoſe ſhare with him that want a Supply, and thanks God that he is ſo bleſſed, as to <hi>give</hi> rather than <hi>receive;</hi> and in every reſpect makes the beſt uſe he can of what he has, to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:103289:179"/>of the Glory of his great Patron, and the Good of his Brethren; and then can ſtep ſecurely, though Dangers and Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes threaten, if God thinks fit to <hi>divert</hi> them, and <hi>continue</hi> to him what he has, he knows he can do it; if not, he knows that all will end for the <hi>beſt</hi> at <hi>laſt,</hi> and ſo, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reſigns what God before had lent him: he is ſatisfied that <hi>Happineſs</hi> does not conſiſt in Abundance, and that a good Conſcience is a continual Feaſt, and therefore, his main Endeavour is to preſerve a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, a Soul clear and unſpotted, and with <hi>that</hi> coarſe Fare will reliſh well, and a homely Garment ſit eaſie upon him; and ſuch <hi>Neceſſaries</hi> as theſe, he that feeds the Ravens; and cloaths the Lillies, will ſurely provide for him. And he that is <hi>thus</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, muſt needs be in perpetual Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Peace; and very <hi>wiſe</hi> conſequently in taking that Courſe, which helps him to thoſe ineſtimable Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>As for the Wiſdom of diſpoſing of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance (when God thinks fit to bleſs a Man with it) according to the Direction of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the Relief of the Poor and Needy; there needs nothing more to recommend it to Chriſtians, than for them to read the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Part of <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. where we are inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Expreſſes of Men's <hi>Charity</hi> ſhall at the great Day of Judgment be particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enquir'd into, and the Charitable rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded infinitely with Glory and Happineſs in Heaven; and the Uncharitable doom'd as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:103289:179"/>Perſons to depart from God the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Bliſs, into Everlaſting Torments, prepar'd for the Devil and his Angels. And, if ſo to direct our Steps in this World, as to avoid the Miſeries of Hell, and arrive at the unſpeakable Happy Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, be the greateſt <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> then is it the greateſt Wiſdom, by a Charitable Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of Mens Abundance to the Poor, to make Proviſion againſt that great Day of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Retribution, when Charity ſhall be ſo particularly enquired into, and ſo highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</p>
            <p>There remains nothing now to be done, but to urge what has been ſaid upon Mens Practice. We have ſeen in this Diſcourſe how great <hi>Folly</hi> 'tis eagerly to deſire and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue <hi>Abundance</hi> of Wealth, that 'tis very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether ever ſuch Deſire ſhall be <hi>gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> or no, and that there is no <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in the <hi>greateſt</hi> Riches when <hi>poſſeſs'd,</hi> and that they are often very ſuddenly loſt again, and then the Grief for being <hi>depriv'd</hi> of them will fill the Soul with abundantly greater <hi>Trouble</hi> than the <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of them did with <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi> and we have ſeen, as the <hi>Folly,</hi> ſo the <hi>Vileneſs</hi> of Covetouſneſs, how much a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is debas'd by thus groveling on the Earth, and placing his Happineſs in what <hi>is</hi> ſo much <hi>beneath</hi> him, and neglecting that which is the only proper Object of his Affections, and is of infinitely greater Value than all the Riches of Ten Thouſand Worlds; we have ſeen likewiſe the <hi>ill Conſequences</hi> of Covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:103289:180"/>what a great <hi>Hindrance</hi> it is to, nay, <hi>Deſtroyer</hi> of Religion, how it indiſpoſes a Man for the Service of God, and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, more than any thing, his ſteady Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Truth; we have been directed to much better Ways of diſpoſing our Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance when we are bleſſed with it, than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in hoarding it up, or waſting it in Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Exceſs; namely, in relieving the Neceſſities of the Poor, which will intitle us to the Reward of a good and faithful Steward, even the Eternal Joy of our dear Lord; and we have ſeen the great <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of a <hi>contented</hi> Mind, the Bleſſedneſs of not <hi>overvaluing</hi> Riches, and the great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that will be made by the <hi>Charitable</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of them, when Chriſt ſhall come to take Account of Mens Works at the great Day of Recompenſe. Wherefore, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all in the excellent Exhortation of our Lord immediately after my Text; let none of us take Anxious and Perplexing <hi>Thought for our Life, what we ſhall eat; nor for the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, what we ſhall put on, for the Life is more than Meat, and the Body than Rayment, and</hi> he that gave the Greater, will, no Queſtion, provide the Leſſer. Let us <hi>conſider the Ravens, for they neither ſow nor reap, have neither Store-Houſe nor Barn, and God feedeth them; how much better are we than the Fowls: And which of us by taking thought, can add one Cubit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Stature? If we then be not able to do what is leaſt, why take we thought for the reſt?</hi> Let us <hi>conſider the Lillies, how they grow, they
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:103289:180"/>toil not, they ſpin not, and yet,</hi> Solomon <hi>in all his Glory, was not arrayed like one of theſe.

               <p>OEternal God, the great Creator and Governour of all things, and whoſe Wiſdom and Goodneſs in all the Diſpoſals of thy Providence is Infinite; grant me the Wiſdom to be contented with my preſent Lot, and ſatisfied with a moderate Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this World's Good, and not to be too

            <p>THIS Parable was ſpoken upon the News that was brought to our Lord of the ſad Fate of ſome Factious <hi>Galileans,</hi> whom <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour had ſet upon and deſtroy'd, mingling their Blood with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:103289:182"/>they were offering. To this, our Lord firſt made this Anſwer; <hi>Suppoſe ye that thoſe</hi> Galileans <hi>were Sinners above all the</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lileans, <hi>becauſe they ſuffered ſuch things? I tell you nay, but except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.

            </p>
            <p>From what our Lord ſaid to his Diſciples upon the ſad Fate of the <hi>Galileans,</hi> and thoſe ſlain by the Tower in <hi>Siloam, think ye that they were Sinners above all,</hi> &amp;c. we may, before we proceed to conſider the Parable, learn this ſhort, but excellent Leſſon; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That when ſudden ill Accidents befall our Neighbours, we do not preſently make Concluſion, as is too often done, (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where there has been any Enmity or Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Parties) that God has met with them by his Judgments for ſome <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Wickedneſs of theirs, and pronounce them <hi>worſe</hi> Men than our ſelves, or others that <hi>eſcape,</hi> becauſe they ſuffer ſuch things; for this is a very <hi>raſh</hi> and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sentence, and may be far from <hi>Truth:</hi>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:103289:183"/>But rather, by God's <hi>Severity</hi> upon others, be inclined to reflect upon our <hi>ſelves,</hi> and humble our ſelves before him for our <hi>own</hi> Iniquities; and entirely reſolve to forſake every Evil Way, leſt <hi>we</hi> likewiſe fall under the <hi>like</hi> Expreſſes of his Vengeance in this World, or of infinitely <hi>worſe</hi> in that which is to come.</p>
            <p>In the Parable it ſelf, is repreſented God's Method of Proceeding with Sinners now under the Goſpel from firſt to laſt; and it is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He plants them in his <hi>Vineyard,</hi> the Church of Chriſt; that there, by the good Cultivating of the Miniſters of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the refreſhing Influences of his Bleſſed Spirit upon their Souls, they may become Fruitful of ſuch good Works, as may fit and prepare them for the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Heavenly Kingdom; to which in due ſeaſon, they are to be <hi>tranſplanted.</hi> After they are thus plac'd in his <hi>Vineyard,</hi> and Cultivated by the Sermons of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, he looks for a proportionable Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from them; and that after all his Care and Goodneſs to them, they would for their Part make him a due Return of the Fruits of Evangelical Righteouſneſs: As, when a Tree is remov'd from a Poorer to a Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Soil, and much Care and Husbandry uſed about it, 'tis expected it ſhould grow and flouriſh accordingly, and bring forth more and better Fruit. After God has, with much Patience and Forbearance, year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:103289:183"/>ſought for Fruit from them, and is as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten diſappointed; his Wiſdom and his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice prompt him to rid his Vineyard of the Incumbrance of thoſe Unprofitable Trees, to remove from the Society of his Faithful Diſciples, thoſe that are a Trouble and a <hi>Scandal</hi> to them; and as Barren Trees are laid aſide to be burnt, ſo to conſign them to thoſe everlaſting Burnings prepar'd for the Devil and his Angels. But, though in Juſtice he purpoſes the Deſtruction of the Unfruitful, yet his infinite Mercy, through the Interceſſion of the Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Jeſus (the <hi>Dreſſer</hi> of this his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Governor</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church) inclines him to a ſtill farther Forbearance till they ſhall be cultivated and manur'd afreſh, by the again repeated Inſtructions and Exhortations of his Servants the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and the reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Motions of the Bleſſed Spirit of Life and Holineſs. And then, if they bear Fruit <hi>well,</hi> Happy will it be for them; but if not, after that he will <hi>cut them down,</hi> and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroy them. Of each of theſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars we ſhall now diſcourſe in their Order.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is, God's wondrous Care and Tenderneſs of Sinners in Planting them in his <hi>Vineyard,</hi> as the Parable expreſſes it; that is, receiving them into the Church of Chriſt, where they are cultivated by the Miniſters of his Kingdom, and their Souls water'd with gentle Showers from Above, the bleſſed Influences of the Holy Spirit,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:103289:184"/>that they may Flouriſh and become Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of ſuch good Works as may prepare them for the Felicities of Heaven, to which in due time they ſhall be Tranſplanted.</p>
            <p>Before the Coming of our Saviour, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was God's Vineyard, his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Incloſure, and the Subject of his more immediate Care and Government; and all but the Seed of <hi>Jacob</hi> were excluded as wild uncultivated Trees, and left to Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Wilderneſs of the World: For ſo, in a ſpiritual Senſe, was all but the Land of <hi>Jewry,</hi> the Lot of their Inheritance. Afterwards, when the Fullneſs of Time was come, that God would take Pity upon the whole Race of <hi>Adam,</hi> and receive all Mankind to his Favour; he then <hi>enlarg'd</hi> that his Vineyard, and gave a Free Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to all that would ſubmit to the <hi>Culture</hi> and Government of his <hi>Eternal Son;</hi> whom he ſent to break down the former Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and make it more <hi>capacious,</hi> even as large as the <hi>World it ſelf,</hi> and committed it to his Management, made him the great <hi>Dreſſer</hi> of this Vineyard, the Head and Governour of this <hi>Univerſal</hi> Church; that through his excellent Directions, and the Care and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of his Servants, and the Decrees from Above of his Divine Grace and Aſſiſtance: And above all, through the wondrous Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his <hi>Precious Blood,</hi> with which he plentifully enrich'd this his new Plantation, it might thrive and flouriſh, and bring forth Fruit meet for him by whom it was dreſs'd,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:103289:184"/>even the <hi>Fruits of the Spirit,</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>meet for Repentance,</hi> ſuch as may advance the Glory of God by the Salvation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Souls, that <hi>none</hi> made after his Image might <hi>periſh,</hi> but <hi>all</hi> come to <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God's Vineyard then being thus <hi>enlarg'd,</hi> and his Church now no longer confin'd to a <hi>Corner</hi> of the World, but by the Coming of Chriſt made <hi>Univerſal,</hi> that <hi>all men might come to the Knowledge of the Truth;</hi> Man is again, as 'twere, ſeated in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God: 'Tis again put into his Power to continue in his Makers Favour, and after a Happy Life in this World, to be <hi>tranſplanted</hi> into that Heavenly Country, where is the Reſidence of the Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and Rivers of ineffable Pleaſures which flow for evermore. As through the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience</hi> of the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> Mankind was driven out of Paradiſe, and doom'd to Live and Labour amongſt Briars and Thorns, as under the Diſpleaſure of his Creator, and then to Dye and Return to his Duſt; ſo through the <hi>Obedience</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> even to the Death of the Croſs, through the Merits of his Blood, and the Atonement of his Sacrifice, all that ſad Sentence and Condemnation is, in a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Senſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd, and we are again planted in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard and Garden of God, recall'd from the Portion of Thorns and Briars, and reſtor'd to the Favour of our Creator, and at length to change this Corruptible for Incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:103289:185"/>this Diſhonour and Weakneſs for Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Power, this Natural for a Spiritual Body, this Mortal Life for Immortality; and by this means is brought to paſs the Saying that is written,

            <p>O Bleſſed Alteration! O happy Change of <hi>Miſery and Shame</hi> for Happineſs and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry! O the Miraculous Love and Goodneſs of God to Mankind, in thus commiſerating our deplorable Condition, and delivering us from the Power of Darkneſs, and tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us into the Kingdom of his Dear Son, and making us <hi>meet</hi> to be Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light! Happy are they who have heard of theſe Glad Tidings, and are planted in this Spiritual Vineyard, and under the Care and Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the great Dreſſer of it <hi>Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> who have ſuch great Helps and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to <hi>bring forth fruit unto Holineſs,</hi> and conſequently ſuch full <hi>Aſſurance of Hope,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6.11.</note> that the <hi>End will be Everlaſting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let Them give Thanks from the Bottom of their Hearts, whom the Lord hath thus Redeem'd, and deliver'd from the Hand of the Infernal Enemy, and be telling of his Salvation from Day to Day: And let us of theſe Happy Iſlands, in the firſt place, magnifie him for this his Infinite Goodneſs; for none have had a greater ſhare of it than we, none better Planted nor better Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, than the Members of this Church of <hi>England;</hi> and (which does much advance
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:103289:185"/>the Bleſſing) none were in a more ſad and <hi>deplorable</hi> Condition than the Inhabitants of theſe Iſlands before the Preaching of the Goſpel. And indeed, what the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſays of God's dealing with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, which was then his Vineyard,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.4.</note> may be very truly ſaid of his gracious Dealing with this our Church, <hi>What could have been done more to his Vineyard that he hath not done in it? He hath planted it in a very fruitful Hill, and fenced it</hi> by his Providence from the Incurſions of its Enemies, <hi>and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd out the Stones thereof,</hi> purg'd it from ſcandalous Hereſies and Superſtitions, which are Stones of Stumbling and Rocks of Offence, <hi>and built a Tower in the midſt of it,</hi> guarded it with the Civil Power, making Kings its Nurſing Fathers, and Queens its Nurſing Mothers, <hi>and made a Wine-preſs in it,</hi> furniſh'd it with all Neceſſaries of Holy Inſtruction, and the Service of an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Miniſtry, to inforce the great Truths of Religion, and lay all the Beauties and Excellencies of it before the People. And now, what could have been done more for this Church than the Lord has already done for it? And what an ineſtimable Happineſs is it that we enjoy, who were Born in this Church, early Conſecrated to God in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and thereby planted in this Vineyard, and ſed with the ſincere and unmix'd Milk of the Word, plainly and without Reſerve, or the cunning Craftineſs of Men that lye in wait to deceive: We are invited to a
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:103289:186"/>Frequent and <hi>Entire</hi> Reception of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lord's Supper, that great Conveyance of the Divine Grace and Aid, and have as many, and as moving Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to live up to our Holy Profeſſion, as are enjoy'd by any Part of the Chriſtian World. What an ineſtimable Happineſs is this! And what great Reaſon have we, as to bleſs God for this his unſpeakable Goodneſs to us, ſo to bring forth the Fruits of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in great Abundance? 'Tis but Juſt and Right that we ſhould do it, and God expects it from <hi>All</hi> that are Planted in his Vineyard, much more from ſuch as have had <hi>extraordinary</hi> Care and Cultivation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon them, as we have had. For ſo, in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> Place, we find in this Parable, that the Owner of the Vineyard came to the <hi>Fig-Tree</hi> he had planted in it, expecting Fruit from it.</p>
            <p>The Fruit that God expects from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that have enjoy'd the Means of Grace and ſpiritual Improvement, is that which is call'd <hi>Fruit meet for Repentance,</hi> and the <hi>Fruits of the Spirit.</hi> Fruits meet for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, are the Advances to a New and Spiritual Life, ſuch as ſhall demonſtrate a ſincere Renovation and Change of Mind, a Turning from a Courſe of Rebellion againſt God, and Hatred of him, to entire Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, and hearty Love. But he that to the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity adds Debauchery of Manners, and inſtead of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:103289:186"/>bringing forth the Fruits of the Spirit, ſuch as <hi>Love, Joy, Peace, Long-Suffering, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance, and ſuch like;</hi> Drudges in the <hi>Works of the Fleſh,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Adultery, Fornication, Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Laſciviouſneſs, Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, Hereſies, Envyings, Murthers, Drunkenneſs,</hi> and ſuch like; ſuch Men as theſe are, as St. <hi>Jude</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>Trees,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jude 12.</note> 
               <hi>whoſe Fruit withereth, without Fruit, twice dead,</hi> or dead a ſecond Time after they were <hi>enliven'd</hi> by the Grace of Chriſt, and planted in his Vineyard, where they might have liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and flouriſh'd and brought forth much Fruit, well pleaſing unto God; and by this their Barrenneſs, are as 'twere <hi>pluck'd up by the Roots, and to whom is reſerv'd the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Darkneſs for ever, and whoſe End is to be burn'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When our Lord, as he was returning from <hi>Bethany</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaw a Fig-Tree at a Diſtance, very promiſing and full of Leaves, and went to it, expecting to find Fruit upon it; but finding nothing thereon but Leaves only, curs'd it and ſaid unto it, let no Fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever; he plainly enough told the World, that the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of Chriſtianity muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be attended with the Fruits of Piety, that he expects to find it ſo, and will ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh where he finds it otherwiſe. The Leaves of a Fig-Tree are broad and ſtrong, and hang thick, and are of a lovely
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:103289:187"/>Colour, and therefore very apt to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, which makes the faireſt Appearance of any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was ever taught the World, and the Title of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> does include all that can be ſuppos'd excellent and good in a Man. But, as the Fig-Tree, beſides flouriſhing Leaves, bears a Delicious <hi>Fruit,</hi> and has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways upon it Fruit coming to Maturity; ſo Chriſtianity muſt not be all <hi>Shew</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but the Fruits of Holineſs muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as well as the Leaves of Fair Speeches, and the outward Performance of ſome of the more Cuſtomary and Publick Duties of it; and, as is obſerv'd in the Fig-Tree, there muſt <hi>always</hi> be ſome Fruit growing to Ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Perfection: God expects to find it ſo, and where he is diſappointed, the Fate of the Barren Fig-Tree will be their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>We are all of us too apt with our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to cover our Spiritual Nakedneſs with Fig-leaves, and by tacking together a few External Obſervances of Religion, think to hide our Shame, and paſs for good Servants and Diſciples of the Lord Jeſus: But this is too thin a covering to conceal our Vileneſs from his Eye, to whom all things lie naked and open, and who knows the very Secrets of the Heart. He that is <hi>indeed</hi> a Follower of Chriſt, and loves him in <hi>Sincerity,</hi> muſt walk as <hi>he</hi> walk'd, imitating his Example, and treading in his Bleſſed Steps, departing from all Iniquity, denying himſelf and all his
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:103289:187"/>vile Luſts and Affections, obeying chearfully the Holy Commands of his great Lord, and giving all diligence to add to his <hi>Faith Virtue, and to Virtue Knowledg, and to Knowledg Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and to Temperance Patience and to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience Godlineſs, and to Godlineſs Brotherly Kindneſs, and to Brotherly Kindneſs Charity;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Per. 1.5, 6, 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>for if theſe things be in us and abound, they make us that we ſhall be neither Barren nor Unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> And he only that has thus his <hi>Fruit</hi> unto <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> ſhall in the <hi>End</hi> attain Everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p>'Tis <hi>Fruit</hi> then, God expects from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, not <hi>Leaves;</hi> not the <hi>Form</hi> of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but the <hi>Power</hi> of it; not to be call'd <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> but to have his Commands <hi>Obeyed.</hi> But, ſince God is infinitely <hi>full</hi> already, and can receive no Addition to his Inexhauſtible Store; ſince our Goodneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth not to <hi>him,</hi> neither is it any Profit to him that we make our Way perfect: It will not be amiſs to enquire upon what Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts God ſo ſtrictly and indiſpenſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that we ſhould be Fruitful? And 'tis upon our <hi>own</hi> Account that we might be happy in <hi>this</hi> World, and made <hi>capable</hi> of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the Glories and Felicities of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, God expects the Fruits of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs from all that name the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and are planted in his Vineyard, that they may be happy in <hi>this</hi> World.</p>
            <pb n="350" facs="tcp:103289:188"/>
            <p>'Tis the great Deſign of our good God to make his Creatures <hi>happy;</hi> and becauſe we are plac'd in <hi>this</hi> World to fit and <hi>prepare</hi> our ſelves for <hi>Heaven,</hi> and are to ſpend a Life here <hi>below;</hi> he has given us a <hi>Rule,</hi> which, if we walk by, we ſhall be happy <hi>here</hi> as well as in the world above; and which, if we diſregard and deviate from, a <hi>double</hi> Miſery will be our Portion.

            <p>'Tis for this Reaſon that our Saviour, the great Dreſſer of God's Vineyard, and his Servants, the Apoſtles, ſo often preſs the Obſervance of ſuch Rules as have chiefly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Comfortable Living in <hi>this</hi> World; as with Relation to others, <hi>Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Charity, Meekneſs, Forbearance, and Forgiveneſs of Injuries, Peaceableneſs, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and Pity,</hi> together with exact <hi>Juſtice and Honeſty;</hi> without which there would be be no Comfort of <hi>Society;</hi> and Men would be like ſo many Wild Beaſts, preying upon and devouring one another. And with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to our <hi>ſelves,</hi> we are taught <hi>Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Sobriety, and Chaſtity, and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in all things, Contentment of Mind, Patience,</hi> and the like; without which, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Man's Mind or Body would be at Eaſe, nor taſte any Comfort and Happineſs
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:103289:188"/>in Life. Indeed, God has been pleas'd to annex the Rewards of <hi>Heaven</hi> to the ſincere and conſtant Practice of theſe Virtues, as a further <hi>Encouragement</hi> to Men chearfully and diligently to ſet about them; but 'tis the Happineſs of <hi>this</hi> World that they have a <hi>direct</hi> Influence upon, and are <hi>therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,</hi> and therefore <hi>encourag'd,</hi> that much Sin and Miſery might be prevented, and Men might be happy in this <hi>lower</hi> World.</p>
            <p>For, as for the contrary <hi>Vices,</hi> as <hi>Cruelty and Unmercifulneſs, Rage and Intemperate Anger, Uncharitableneſs and Revenge, Strife and Envy, Injuſtice and Oppreſſion,</hi> and the like; theſe would make a Hell upon Earth, and quite deſtroy Society and all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of it, and make the World like a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,</hi> and force Men to the Shelter of Rocks and Mountains, and Dens and Caves of the Earth: And where-ever <hi>they</hi> ſhould go, if <hi>Intemperance</hi> and ungovern'd <hi>Luſt,</hi> and Inordinate <hi>Deſire</hi> and <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Senſe, Diſcontent</hi> and <hi>Anxiety of Mind, Impatience,</hi> and the like, ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them; their Miſery would be <hi>endleſs,</hi> and Happineſs an utter <hi>Stranger</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>And therefore, as much as the Happineſs of Life is to be valu'd, ſo much are we bound to praiſe and adore the Infinite and <hi>Diſintereſſed</hi> Goodneſs of God, who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us ſuch Rules of Living as if <hi>obſerv'd,</hi> will <hi>procure</hi> that Happineſs; and who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that we may not <hi>fail</hi> to obſerve them, has over and above propos'd to us ineffably
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:103289:189"/>Glorious Rewards in Heaven if we <hi>do,</hi> and threatned as great a Miſery in Hell if we do <hi>not.</hi> That is, he has done all that is <hi>poſſible</hi> to be done to make a <hi>free Agent</hi> happy in the World that <hi>now</hi> is, as well as that which is to come; and therefore 'tis highly reaſonable that we give all poſſible Praiſe and Thankſgiving to that his Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and uſe all poſſible Diligence to <hi>co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> with his Gracious Intentions for our Good; for 'tis <hi>our</hi> Happineſs that will be promoted by it, not <hi>his.</hi> And this is the firſt Reaſon why God ſo <hi>indiſpenſibly</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us the <hi>Fruits of Righteouſneſs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis impoſſible we ſhould be happy even in <hi>this</hi> World without them.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> Reaſon of this is, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe 'tis impoſſible we ſhould be happy in the <hi>next</hi> Life.</p>
            <p>The Happineſs of the next Life, we are well aſſur'd, conſiſts in an intimate Viſion and Enjoyment of <hi>God;</hi> who is the Fountain of Excellency and <hi>Perfection,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of <hi>Bliſs;</hi> and God being an infinitely Pure and <hi>Holy</hi> Being; and it being neceſſary to <hi>Enjoyment,</hi> that there ſhould be a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence and <hi>Agreeableneſs</hi> between the Object and the Faculty; no Soul but what is Pure and <hi>Holy,</hi> is <hi>capable</hi> of enjoying a Pure and <hi>Holy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Soul therefore of every Man, being, ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſtain'd and <hi>polluted,</hi> full of vile Affections and Luſts, ſuch as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it <hi>uncapable</hi> of ſo <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:103289:189"/>'tis neceſſary that it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and <hi>purified,</hi> and have Heavenly Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Deſires planted in the Room of thoſe Vile and Brutiſh ones, and recover the Divine Likeneſs which has been ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>defac'd,</hi> that ſo at length, by the Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Excerciſe of the Divine Life <hi>here,</hi> we may become, in ſome Meaſure, <hi>capable</hi> of enjoying the Celeſtial Happineſs that flows from the Contemplation and Love of the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Good.</hi> Or, in the Words of St. <hi>John,</hi> that being <hi>like</hi> him in this State of <hi>Probation,</hi> we may be <hi>prepar'd</hi> to ſee <hi>ſee him as he is,</hi> in the Regions of Glory.</p>
            <p>And this, an Obſervance of the Precepts of our Holy Religion will effect; and they were <hi>therefore</hi> given that they might effect it. We are exhorted to be <hi>poor in Spirit, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and <hi>reſign'd</hi> to the Will of God, that ſo we may be conducted ſafely to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven; <hi>to hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs,</hi> that we may be <hi>fill'd</hi> with <hi>Grace</hi> here, and <hi>Glory</hi> hereafter; to <hi>mourn</hi> for our former Vileneſs, and Degeneracy, and <hi>Eſtrangement</hi> from God, and flee from all Wickedneſs, and ſincerely endeavour a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that ſo we may be <hi>comforted</hi> in the Day of Retribution, and, as good and faithful Servants, be receiv'd into the <hi>Joy of our Lord.</hi> We are urg'd to <hi>Purity of Heart</hi> that we may <hi>ſee God,</hi> to be holy as he is holy, perfect as he is perfect, pure as he is pure, becauſe he <hi>hates</hi> Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and into <hi>his</hi> Preſence no <hi>unclean</hi> thing can enter, and without Holineſs no Man <hi>can</hi>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:103289:190"/>ſee the Lord. So that the Reaſon why God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that we ſhould <hi>bring forth Fruit unto Holineſs,</hi> is, that the <hi>end may be everlaſting Life.</hi> Theſe are the Reaſons why God ſo <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and <hi>indiſpenſibly</hi> requires that we ſhould be fruitful of good Works, after he has planted us in his Vineyard, and cultivated us by his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Son, and his Servants the Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors, the Biſhops, and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Miniſters of his Kingdom. <hi>O that Men would therefore praiſe the Lord for his Goodneſs, and declare the Wonders that he doth for the Children of Men!</hi> Pſal. 107.8.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> thing this Parable informs us of, is God's <hi>Long-Suffering</hi> towards Sinners, and that, though he does indeed <hi>expect</hi> the Fruits of Righteouſneſs from thoſe that are planted in his Spiritual Vineyard, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, yet he expects it with much Patience and <hi>Forbearance;</hi> and is not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely rigid as to puniſh for the <hi>firſt</hi> Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment he meets with, but waits ſtill <hi>further</hi> to ſee if Time will work Amendment: And this is expreſs'd in the Parable, by the Lord of the Vineyard, his coming <hi>three Years</hi> ſeeking Fruit on his Fig. Tree, and ſtill finding none.</p>
            <p>Of this <hi>Long-Suffering</hi> and Forbearance of God, every <hi>Sinner</hi> that is yet <hi>alive</hi> is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Which of the <hi>beſt</hi> of us have not been <hi>leſs</hi> fruitful than we <hi>ought</hi> to have been, and then God may with the greateſt Reaſon expect from us, conſidering the Means of Improvement that we have enjoy'd; and this not only for <hi>three</hi> Years, but for three many
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:103289:190"/>times <hi>repeated?</hi> How <hi>many</hi> have been <hi>wholly unfruitful,</hi> and that for Scores of Years, notwithſtanding all the Care and Cultivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God's Miniſters; and have been all the while in the Service of the great Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of God and Man, doing Deſpight to the Holy Spirit, Slaves to their vile Paſſions and Luſts, without Thought of Religion, and without God in the World: And yet, through God's Infinite Mercy and <hi>Long-Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,</hi> are repriev'd from Deſtruction, and ſtill in Poſſibility of Salvation, upon their intire <hi>Repentance,</hi> and bringing forth Fruits <hi>meet</hi> for it for the Future! As many Years as a Sinner has liv'd ſince he could diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Good and Evil, ſo long has God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Fruit from him, and ſo often been diſappointed, and ſo long patiently <hi>forborn</hi> him; and conſidering how <hi>hateful</hi> Sin is to God, how highly provoking it is for his Creatures that have receiv'd their <hi>Being</hi> from him, and all the Bleſſings they have ſince enjoy'd; nay, for whom his only Son in wondrous Love, ſhed his moſt Precious Blood, that he might purchaſe to himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works; and who have been ſo long planted in his Vineyard, and dreſs'd with the greateſt Publick Care and Tenderneſs, ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on <hi>God</hi>'s Side is wanting to their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; conſidering how provoking 'tis for Creatures, under ſuch <hi>ſtrong</hi> Obligations, to ſerve and obey him to the utmoſt of their Powers, obſtinately and continually for ſo
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:103289:191"/>many Years to rebel againſt him: 'Tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Miracle of Divine <hi>Forbearance</hi> that any wilſul Sinner is on this Side <hi>Hell.</hi> But, to our unſpeakable Comfort, and our unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Shame</hi> too, ſo it is; and ſtill this is the Voice of the Father of Compaſſions, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, from your evil Ways, for why will ye die O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael!</p>
            <p>'Tis indeed <hi>of the Lord's Mercies only that we are not conſum'd, and becauſe his Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fail not, but are new every Morning;</hi> but, though to him <hi>belong Mercies and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> yet to <hi>us</hi> nothing but <hi>Shame and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Face;</hi> who have turn'd our Backs ſo long upon ſuch Infinite Long-Suffering and Forbearance, and have reſus'd to be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our Happineſs. But let us not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, God's Spirit will not <hi>always</hi> in this Manner ſtrive with us; and he that ſtill <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſes the Riches of</hi> this <hi>his Goodneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2.4, 5, 8.</note> and is not by it <hi>led to Repentance,</hi> but <hi>after his Hardneſs and Impenitent Heart, treaſureth up to himſelf Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath, and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Righteous Judgment of God, who will render to every Man according to his Deeds: Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and Anguiſh,</hi> ſhall at length (as <hi>ſlowly</hi> as it moves) certainly overtake him, and cruſh him into Ruine.</p>
            <p>For ſo, in the next Place we are told in this Parable, That when the Lord of the Vineyard had long expected Fruit from his Fig Tree, and ſtill found none; he ſaid, <hi>Cut it down, why cumbereth it the Ground?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="357" facs="tcp:103289:191"/>
            <p>And indeed, God's <hi>Forbearance</hi> and Long-Suffering of Sinners, is ſo far from being an Encouragement to them to go on ſtill in their Wickedneſs; that, if they rightly conſider it, 'tis a prevailing Motive to a ſpeedy and ſincere <hi>Repentance.</hi> For <hi>Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> does imply a preceding <hi>Guilt</hi> and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxiouſneſs to <hi>Puniſhment;</hi> which, though <hi>reſpited</hi> for a Time, is not wholly <hi>remitted;</hi> but if it be ineffectual to the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Sinner, will be at length pour'd down in full Meaſure upon his Head. And therefore, when a wicked Man reflects upon his evil Courſe of Life, and withall ſees himſelf as yet <hi>forborn</hi> by the offended Majeſty of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that he lives as ſecurely as better Men; if his Luſts have not quite blinded his Reaſon, he muſt needs conclude that this Forbearance of ſo <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Holy</hi> a God, who infinitely <hi>hates</hi> Iniquity, and is reſolv'd to puniſh it, and has declar'd that he will not <hi>finally</hi> ſpare the guilty; is only in order to his <hi>Amendment,</hi> that ſo he may have Time to <hi>review</hi> the Actions of his paſt Life, and attend to the Miſerable Conſequences of them, and ſo be inclin'd to <hi>return</hi> to that Obedience to God which hitherto he has ſo ſhamefully neglected; becauſe, if he ſtill perſiſts in his Rebellion againſt his Maker, and is Incorrigible, <hi>Mercy</hi> ſhall be turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Judgment,</hi> Deſtruction ſhall overtake him like an armed Man, and he ſhall not eſcape.</p>
            <p>The Divine Juſtice in this Caſe may be compar'd to the Courſe of a <hi>River;</hi> it may
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:103289:192"/>be damm'd up and its Progreſs hindred for a Time; but unleſs its Stream be <hi>diverted</hi> ſome other Way, 'twill ſwell till at laſt it bear down the Obſtacle, and ruſh on with greater Violence for being interrupted in its Way: So here, the great Benignity and Compaſſion of God's Nature may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times interpoſe between the Stroke of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and the wretched Offender, to ſee if he will repent and do no more wickedly, that ſo the Divine <hi>Nemeſis</hi> may ſteer another Courſe; but if all this prove at length to no Purpoſe, if the Man <hi>refuſe to return and ſeek after God,</hi> he will whet his <hi>Sword and make ready his Arrows againſt the Face of him,</hi> Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance ſhall then have its <hi>free Courſe,</hi> and Torrents of God's enflam'd Anger ſhall overwhelm his Soul for ever. There are many Places in Scripture to this Purpoſe, and which are ſo obvious to every Attentive Reader, that they need not be here recited: And truly, <hi>irreclaimable</hi> Sinners are ſo great a Diſhonour to God, and Diſparagement to Religion, and like a Contagious <hi>Peſt</hi> to Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, that they deſerve to be remov'd to a Place more proper for them, the Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Devil and his Angels.</p>
            <p>But ſtill the Compaſſionate Jeſus is our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor; and when, after God's long <hi>abus'd</hi> Forbearance Juſtice is ready to ſtrike, he pleads in Vertue of his Blood for a ſtill <hi>longer Reprieve:</hi> Hoping that at length the Sinner may be awaken'd by the Sermons of the Goſpel, and the inward Motions and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations

For ſo in the next Place 'tis ſaid in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> that when the Lord of the Vineyard gave Order that the Barren Fig-Tree ſhould be <hi>cut down,</hi> the <hi>Dreſſer</hi> of the Vineyard, by whom our <hi>Saviour</hi> is repreſented, <hi>anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaid unto him, let it alone this Year alſo, till I ſhall dig about it and dung it.</hi>

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:103289:193"/>Impreſſions of the Spirit of God: That, as looſening the Mould about the Roots of a Tree, and cheriſhing it with the kindly Warmth of Dung, is very conducive to the ſpreading of its Fibres, and making it flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and grow fruitful; ſo, theſe gracious Methods of the great Dreſſer of God's ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Vinevard, Chriſt Jeſus, may ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the Souls of Chriſtians, as to make them bear much Fruit, to the Glory of God, and their own everlaſting Salvation.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>laſt</hi> Courſe that can be taken for a Sinner's Safety; and if this will not prevail with him to take care of his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there is no longer Hope. 'Tis like the Interceſſion of a Favourite for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd Criminal, upon Condition of his better Converſation for the future; but if he again returns to his old vile Courſes, his Friends then abandon him, as one that <hi>deſerves</hi> to periſh. And ſo here in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, Chriſt the Beloved Son of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes for a miſerable Sinner ready for Deſtruction, and begs a <hi>Reprieve</hi> for him, to ſee if Time and farther Care, will cure his Wickedneſs; but if <hi>this</hi> proves ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, there remains nothing but <hi>a fearful Expectation of Judgment and fiery Indignation.</hi> His <hi>Interceſſor</hi> will <hi>then</hi> give him over for <hi>Deſperate,</hi> and ſuffer Juſtice to take its Courſe; for ſo ſaid the Dreſſer of the Vineyard to his Lord, <hi>If after I have digg'd about it, and dung'd it, it bear fruit well; but if not, then after that thou ſhalt cut it down.</hi>

            <p>And, when the dreadful Day of Doom ſhall come, and the miſerable Wretches appear before his Throne, to receive the juſt Recompenſe of their obſtinate Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; then ſhall <hi>That Jeſus</hi> who once ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly pleaded with God in their <hi>Behalf,</hi> pronounce the Dreadful Sentence, <hi>Depart from me ye Curſed into Everlaſting Fire.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me your <hi>Saviour,</hi> and <hi>once</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and You; Be from henceforch and for ever depriv'd of all <hi>Hope</hi> of <hi>Redemption</hi> and Reinſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into the Favour of my Father; Be baniſh'd for ever from all Intercourſe with <hi>Heaven,</hi> without any <hi>Interceſſor,</hi> any <hi>propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory Sacrifice,</hi> any <hi>Advocate</hi> to plead their Cauſe, and without any Place for <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> to Eternal Ages: Depart to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Endleſs <hi>Horror</hi> and <hi>Deſpair,</hi> in the Society of the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>his Angels.</hi> And this is but the juſt Demerit of your <hi>Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Wickedneſs,</hi> who <hi>deſpis'd the Goodneſs of God that ſhould have led you to Repentance.</hi>

O Lord, as is thy Majeſty, ſo is thy Mercy! O make me duely ſenſible of thy tender Care of my Happineſs, and may it never, through my wretched Obſtinacy, be in vain! And in vain it would be, were not thy long-ſuffering wonderful. With what ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Patience doſt thou wait to ſee if at length I ſhall be Fruitful! How often have I diſappointed thy juſt Expectations, and yet thou haſt ſtill forborn me through thine own Compaſſions and the Interceſſion of my dear Redeemer, the Dreſſer of thy Vineyard, who hath ply'd me with new Methods of Converſion, freſh Applications to invigorate my Piety, that at the laſt I may return thee acceptable Fruits, and eſcape the ſad Puniſhment of Barrenneſs. Thou haſt done all, O bleſſed God, that can be done to ſecure the Happineſs of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and Free Agents: I therefore beg,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:103289:195"/>with all the Earneſtneſs of an awaken'd Soul, that thy Goodneſs, Long-ſuffering, and Forbearance, may ſoften my Spirit, and lead me to Repentance, and melt me into Shame, and Tears of Penitential Sorrow, for having ſo long abuſed the tender Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſo good a God. O let not thy Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ever extinguiſh the Dread of thy Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, which though ſlow is ſure; and may I ſeriouſly conſider, that if this thy Mercy is not effectual to my Reformation, 'twill but add weight to the Eternal Ruine I deſerve. May theſe Conſiderations, moſt gracious God, never depart from my Mind till Fruit be added to my Leaves, and I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the <hi>Power</hi> of True Godlineſs; which Thing if thou wilt grant me, then will I praiſe thee without ceaſing, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie thy Goodneſs for ever and ever. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

                  <p>And Jeſus ſaid, a certain Man had two Sons:</p>
                  <p>And the younger of them ſaid to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Father, give me the portion of Goods that falleth to me. And he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided unto them his Living.</p>
                  <p>And not many days after, the younger Son gather'd all together, and took his Journey into a far Country, and there waſted his Subſtance in riotous living.</p>
                  <p>And when he had ſpent all, there aroſe a mighty Famine in that Land; and he began to be in want.</p>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:103289:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>And he went and joyned himſelf to a Citizen of that Country, and he ſent him into his Fields to feed Swine.</p>
                  <p>And he would fain have filled his Belly with the Husks that the Swine did eat; and no man gave unto him.</p>
                  <p>And when he came to himſelf, he ſaid, How many hired Servants of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have Bread enough, and to ſpare, and I periſh with Hunger!</p>
                  <p>I will ariſe and go to my Father, and will ſay unto him, Father, I have ſinned against Heaven and before thee,</p>
                  <p>And am no more worthy to be called thy Son, make me as one of thy hired Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
                  <p>And he aroſe, and came to his Father. But when he was yet a great way off, his Father ſaw him, and had Compaſſion, and ran, and fell on his Neck, and kiſſed him.</p>
                  <p>And the Son ſaid unto him, Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</p>
                  <p>But the Father ſaid to his Servants, bring forth the best Robe, and put it on him, and put a Ring on his Hand, and Shooes on his Feet.</p>

            <p>THIS whole Chapter, from the Third Verſe to the End, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to repreſent the great Tenderneſs and <hi>Compaſſion</hi> of God towards Sinners; his great Deſire that they ſhould <hi>Repent,</hi> and turn from their wicked Courſes; and how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſing to him it is, when they ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do ſo. And this is expreſs'd in Three Parables; The Firſt, of a Man's ſeeking diligently a Sheep that he had loſt, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reſt of his Flock till he had found it; and then rejoycing greatly, and telling his Neighbours the good News, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to partake of his Joy. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, of a Woman's having loſt a Piece of Silver, and ſeeking very carefully till ſhe had found it; and then, in like manner, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing with her Friends for <hi>her</hi> good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. And the Third Parable is, that of the <hi>Prodigal Son:</hi> And becauſe they are All to the ſame purpoſe, 'twill be ſufficient to diſcourſe of <hi>One</hi> of them only; and the <hi>Laſt</hi> being the moſt <hi>full</hi> and <hi>comprehenſive,</hi> I ſhall conſider <hi>That.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Occaſion of Our Lord's ſpeaking theſe Parables, was, The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> finding fault with him for Inſtructing

To this Objection of theirs againſt him, he anſwers in the Parables before mention'd, and ſhews, how unreaſonably uncharitable they were, to think much of his Teaching and Converſing with thoſe, who <hi>becauſe</hi> the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of Men, had therefore the moſt <hi>Need</hi> of his holy Inſtructions and excellent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that they might be Reform'd and Reclaim'd from their wicked Practices. For, as he ſaid elſewhere, the <hi>Whole</hi> have no need of a Phyſician, but thoſe that are <hi>Sick;</hi> and therefore he came to Seek and to Save thoſe that were <hi>loſt,</hi> and <hi>Not to call the Righteous but Sinners to Repentance.</hi> Nay more, he tells them in the 7th and 10th Verſes of this Chapter, that <hi>There ſhall be more Joy in Heaven, in the Preſence of the Angels of God, over One Sinner that Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, than over Ninety and Nine Juſt Perſons that need no Repentance;</hi> or ſuch a <hi>total</hi> Change of Mind as is in a Sinner that <hi>breaks off</hi> his vile Courſes by Repentance. And farther to explain and enforce this great and moſt comfortable Truth, and repreſent it more lively to their Apprehenſions, he ſpake the Parable of the <hi>Prodigal Son;</hi> and therein, very naturally and movingly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes theſe <hi>Four</hi> Things.</p>
            <pb n="369" facs="tcp:103289:198"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The great <hi>Extravagancy</hi> of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, when they give themſelves up to the Conduct of their <hi>own</hi> Wills and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and are weary of the Government of God their Heavenly Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>ſad</hi> Condition ſuch Men quickly reduce themſelves to by that their Extravagancy and looſe ſelf-will'd Courſe of Life, or in other Words, the miſerable Conſequences of Debauchery and Riot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſharp <hi>Remorſe</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> that attends ſuch Courſes, the Shame and Sorrow for them, and the Reſolutions of an <hi>awaken'd</hi> Sinner to return again to his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The great <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion</hi> of the Father of Spirits to ſuch as Repent in <hi>earneſt,</hi> and <hi>keep</hi> their Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; His Readineſs to receive them again to his Favour, and great Joy for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, <hi>Becauſe they were dead but are alive again, were loſt but are found.</hi> Which laſt Particular is the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the <hi>greater</hi> Joy that is in Heaven over one <hi>Sinner</hi> that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth,</hi> than over Ninety and Nine <hi>Juſt</hi> perſons that <hi>need</hi> no Repentance; and is a very ſatisfactory Account of our Lord's ſo often Converſing with and Inſtructing <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans</hi> and <hi>Sinners:</hi> For they had the moſt <hi>need</hi> of that great Phyſician of Souls, and conſequently <hi>their</hi> Salvation would cauſe the <hi>greateſt</hi> Joy in Heaven; and therefore our Compaſſionate Saviour ſo induſtriouſly endeavour'd their <hi>Converſion,</hi> And, had
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:103289:199"/>the <hi>Phariſees</hi> had any of that Goodneſs in them they ſo much <hi>pretended</hi> to, they would have <hi>rejoyced</hi> at our Lord's Charity, and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd</hi> and <hi>lov'd</hi> him for it, rather than have <hi>murmur'd</hi> at it as they did, and uſed it as an <hi>Objection</hi> againſt him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> Thing expreſs'd in this Parable is the great <hi>Extravagancy</hi> of Wicked Men when they give themſelves up to the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their own Wills and Affections, and are weary of the Government of God their Heavenly Father. 'Tis repreſented here, by a Prodigal Young-Man's leaving his Father and rambling into a far Country, and there waſting his Subſtance with <hi>Riotous Living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Impatience of Government and <hi>Reſtraint,</hi> and a Deſire of being <hi>Free,</hi> and at Liberty to follow their own Inclinations and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions; is that which firſt prompts Men, with the young Prodigal in the Parable, to leave their Heavenly Father, and get as far from his Government as they can; and when they have laid aſide the Thoughts of <hi>Religion,</hi> then to take their Swing, and do what ſeems good in their own Eyes. And with this <hi>fancied</hi> Liberty they are at <hi>firſt</hi> mightily <hi>pleas'd,</hi> and wiſh it could be <hi>always</hi> ſo; that is, that there were no <hi>God,</hi> or no <hi>Religion</hi> to awe and <hi>confine</hi> their Deſires; but that they might be a Law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their own Will the ſole Meaſure of their Actions: For ſo the Fooliſh Young-Man in the Parable, we read could not be
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:103289:199"/>ſatisfied till he had his Fortune in his own Hands, to diſpoſe of as he liſted; <hi>Father, give me the portion of Goods that belongeth to me;</hi> and as ſoon as he had it, he got as far from his Father as he could, and then, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied not his Soul whatever it deſired, or as the Parable hath it, <hi>Not many days after, the younger Son gather'd all together, and took his Journey into a far Country, and there waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Subſtance with Riotous Living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And juſt ſo it is with a Sinner. He finds <hi>Religion</hi> will oblige him to a <hi>ſerious</hi> and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect Converſation, and that if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in the Family of the Faithful, he muſt live <hi>ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World,</hi> and <hi>deny</hi> his Bodily Appetites and Deſires, and keep them under Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Spirit; and imitate the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of his Heavenly Father, <hi>be holy, pure, and perfect, as he is,</hi> becauſe he abominates Iniquity, and into his Preſence no unclean Thing can enter. But theſe are <hi>hard</hi> Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; this is a Servitude that he looks upon as <hi>unſufferable;</hi> and he has (as he thinks) a much eaſier and pleaſanter way of Living in his Eye, and which he <hi>longs</hi> to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and therefore reſolves, once for all, to ſhake off the galling Yoke of Religion, and get as far from the Government of his divine Parent as he can, and become his own Maſter; and then he thinks he ſhall be happy. So blinded are Sinners by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of Sin, as to ſhun Happineſs and embrace Ruin; to look upon the <hi>Glorious
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:103289:200"/>Liberty of the Sons of God</hi> as the greateſt <hi>Slavery,</hi> and exchange it for the vile Drudgery of Vice; to run from that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Being who is the Fountain of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Happineſs, and inſiſt in the Track that leads to Eternal Ruin! An unfortunate End is always the Conſequence of lawleſs Liberty; and as a Ship without a Helm or Governour, inſtead of arriving at the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is ſoon ſplit upon Rocks, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with Quickſands; ſuch is the Caſe of a Sinner, that impatient of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reſtraints of Religion, is reſolved to quit it, and take his own Courſe.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould Men be ſo weary of the Government of God, and deſire ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be at their own Diſpoſal? Is not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion the moſt <hi>Reaſonable</hi> Service? And ſhould it not be the greateſt Pleaſure to a Rational Creature to act according to the beſt Reaſon. Is not God the <hi>wiſeſt,</hi> the moſt <hi>powerful,</hi> and the moſt kind and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent</hi> Being too? And is it not more eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible to be <hi>govern'd</hi> by infinite <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>directed</hi> in the right Track to <hi>Happineſs</hi> by infinite <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſhielded</hi> from Dangers by infinite <hi>Power;</hi> than to be hurried on by the blind Force of brutiſh and unruly Paſſions to our Unhappineſs and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and expoſe our ſelves to all the Malice of Hell, by yielding to the Temptations of the Devil, and forfeiting the Protection of the Almighty? Certainly, if Men would but <hi>conſider,</hi> inſtead of deſiring with the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:103289:200"/>Prodigal Son, to be free from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this our Heavenly Father, and to take their <hi>own</hi> Courſe at a <hi>Diſtance</hi> from him; they would ſay with Holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, One Day in thy Courts is better than a Thouſand, I had rather be a Door-keeper in the Houſe of my God, than to dwell in the Tents of Ungodlineſs;</hi> and confeſs in the Words of our Church, that his Service is perfect Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And the ſilly young Prodigal in the Parable ſoon found by a coſtly Experience, the Difference between living under the mild and prudent Government of his Father, and being left to the Conduct of his own ill inſtructed and <hi>green</hi> Head. But before I proceed to this Conſideration, I ſhall briefly ſhew how fitly <hi>Vice</hi> is repreſented by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prodigality, in the Words of this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is <hi>waſting a Man's Subſtance</hi> or Eſtate, <hi>in riotous</hi> or profuſe and extravagant <hi>Living;</hi> or without any Regard to the <hi>future,</hi> ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring away what he has in exceſſive Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: And therefore a wicked Man is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>greateſt Prodigal</hi> in the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he <hi>waſtes</hi> and deſtroys what is of the greateſt <hi>Value</hi> and Eſteem, and that in the moſt <hi>profligate</hi> Manner, without any thought of what ſhall be <hi>hereafter,</hi> only that he may gratifie his preſent Appetites and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Nothing is a more <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Good, and more to be priz'd and carefully <hi>preſerv'd</hi> than the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> or thoſe Bleſſed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:103289:201"/>and Inſpirations of the Holy Spirit, whereby Men are inwardly inclin'd to <hi>purſue</hi> what will make for their Eternal <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and <hi>diſſwaded</hi> from, and warned to <hi>avoid</hi> what will bring them to endleſs Ruine. Now this <hi>Grace of God</hi> a Sinner turns into <hi>Laſciviouſneſs;</hi> deſpiſes and neglects, nay <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts</hi> the Motions of the Spirit of Life and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and cloſes with the Temptations and Suggeſtions of the Spirit of Vileneſs and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity; and does this ſo <hi>continually</hi> and with ſo much <hi>Obſtinacy,</hi> that he daily waſtes that ineſtimable Treaſure, and more and more grieves that Bleſſed Spirit, and forces him to withdraw his Influences, till at length they are quite <hi>extinguiſh'd</hi> in his Soul, and a deſperate ſpiritual <hi>Poverty</hi> ſucceed, an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Want</hi> of that Divine Grace, which they ſo profligately waſted when they had it. And no Poverty certainly ſo miſerable as that which will ſtarve and famiſh the <hi>Soul,</hi> and bring it to <hi>Eternal Death;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Prodigality like that which ſquanders away that which is the only Nouriſhment of the Spiritual Life: Eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider for <hi>what</hi> it is that a Sinner is thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal of ſo great a Treaſure, namely, the gratifying a few Brutiſh Luſts, and the acting ſuch Vices as bring no true <hi>Satisfaction</hi> along with them, but are full of <hi>Vexation</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment</hi> in <hi>this</hi> World, and will at laſt ſink the Soul into the loweſt Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Time</hi> is likewiſe a very ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Good, and highly to be valu'd, and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:103289:201"/>carefully improv'd, becauſe 'tis the only Opportunity we have of ſecuring our main Intereſt, the Happineſs of <hi>Eternity;</hi> and when <hi>Time</hi> ſhall be at an <hi>End,</hi> that is, to every <hi>particular</hi> Perſon when Death ſhall put a Period to this Life, then comes that Night in which no Man can work, then the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſhall be for ever at an End, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Men have improv'd or waſted their <hi>Time</hi> in <hi>this</hi> World, ſo ſhall their <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> be <hi>happy</hi> or <hi>miſerable</hi> in the <hi>next.</hi> And therefore, he is indeed very fooliſhly prodigal, who without any Thought of hereafter, waſtes this precious Treaſure, this only Opportunity of making himſelf for ever happy, in <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Folly,</hi> in pleaſing and humouring his Body, and neglects the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his Soul; and inſtead of <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his Salvation with Fear and trembling,</hi> ſecures to himſelf Eternal <hi>Miſery.</hi> And this does every wilful Sinner, when, with the Prodigal in the Parable, he waſtes this his Subſtance in Luxurious and Riotous Living, and ſtudies nothing but how to gratifie the <hi>lower</hi> Life, looking no further than this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World for Happineſs, 'till his Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity be quite loſt, and he is ſurpriz'd into an unchangeably Miſerable Condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when 'twas put into his Hand to make himſelf <hi>happy</hi> if he <hi>would,</hi> he neglected it, and choſe the Track to <hi>Ruine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Glorious Reverſion of our <hi>Heavenly Inheritance,</hi> is a Treaſure likewiſe that can never be ſufficiently valu'd; <hi>for Eye
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:103289:202"/>hath not ſeen nor Ear heard, neither can it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Heart of Man to conceive,</hi> the Felicities and Glories of it. Now this, we are aſſur'd by him that cannot <hi>lie,</hi> and whoſe it is to <hi>beſtow,</hi> ſhall be the Reward of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and ſincere Religion; all this is laid up for them that love God and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. And therefore, for a Man that knows all this to be ſo, prodigally to throw away all Expectation of, and Title to ſuch a Reverſion as this, upon ſuch low and profligate Accounts as the wallowing in the filthy Pleaſures of a Goat or a Swine, or the heaping up Treaſures of Gold and Silver which are as <hi>unſatisfying</hi> as they are <hi>uncertain</hi> and <hi>periſhing,</hi> or for the Sake of a little emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Honour, or the like: This is the very Highth of profligate Extravagancy, and ſuch, as one would think, no ſenſible Man ſhould ever be guilty of.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe and many other, nay, indeed <hi>all</hi> Accounts, 'tis very true that a wicked Man is the greateſt Prodigal in the World; for he waſtes and throws away what is of higheſt Value to a Man; and that, for what is no better than <hi>Vanity and Vexation of Spirit.</hi>

            <p>And thus much for the <hi>firſt thing</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this Parable, <hi>viz.</hi> the great <hi>Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy</hi> of ungodly Men, when they give themſelves up to the Guidance of their <hi>own</hi> Wills and Affections, and grow weary of the Government of <hi>God</hi> their Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Like the Prodigal Son, they <hi>waſte</hi> their moſt precious <hi>Subſtance,</hi> in <hi>riotous and profligate living.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> thing expreſs'd in this Parable, is the <hi>ſad Condition</hi> ſuch Men ſoon reduce themſelves to by that their Extravagancy and looſe ſelf-will'd Courſe of Life; or in other Words, the Miſerable <hi>Conſequences</hi> of Debauchery and Riot, and of following ſo <hi>Blind</hi> a Guide as Mens unruly Paſſions and Luſts. For ſo in the Parable, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal Young Man had <hi>ſpent all, there aroſe a mighty Famine in that Land, and he began to be in Want, and went and joyn'd himſelf to a Citizen of that Country, who ſent him into his Fields to feed Swine: And he would fain have fill'd his Belly with the Husks that the Swine did eat, but no Man gave unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> ill Conſequence then of this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality</hi> or Lawleſs Extravagant Living, is Spiritual <hi>Want;</hi> or a Scarcity and <hi>Famine</hi> of the Divine <hi>Grace</hi> in the <hi>Soul;</hi> which is by ſo much more to be dreaded than a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of Proviſions for the <hi>Body,</hi> as <hi>Eternal</hi> Miſery and Death is more terrible than <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral.</hi> The Grace of God, is queſtionleſs the Nouriſhment of the Divine Life; and which, if once withdrawn, will leave the Soul <hi>dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins:</hi> Now an obſtinate Courſe of Diſobedience to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will, drives out that Life-giving Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and makes the Soul <hi>uncapable</hi> of Vital Union with ſo pure a Spirit; and, as a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul is <hi>forc'd</hi> to leave a Body rotten and <hi>waſted,</hi> and unapt any longer to <hi>entertain</hi> it, ſo this <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> is <hi>thruſt</hi> out from a <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted</hi> ſinful <hi>Soul,</hi> And conſequently, there

            <p>And certainly, no Man that conſiders what a Diſmal Condition that Soul is in, which is reduced to ſuch <hi>Extremity</hi> of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Want as this; how full of Horrour and Deſpair as doom'd to endleſs Miſery, and <hi>ſeal'd</hi> up to Deſtruction, which he ſees day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nearer and nearer approaching, and <hi>no</hi> way to <hi>eſcape,</hi> but (like a Wretch immur'd between two Walls, there to be ſtarv'd to Death) in continual Expectation of her ſad End: No Man that conſiders this, with that Seriouſneſs he ought, but will be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to <hi>waſte</hi> what is ſo <hi>neceſſary</hi> to his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Subſiſtence; i. e.</hi> by no means grieve, or reſiſt, or quench that Life-giving Spirit, by whom all true Religion <hi>lives, and moves, and hath its Being,</hi> and which if neglected and oppos'd will be <hi>withdrawn,</hi> and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for <hi>ever.</hi> If like <hi>Eſau,</hi> we ſell this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable <hi>Bleſſing</hi> for a Meſs of <hi>Pottage,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the Food of our Souls that we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge our Senſual Appetites, we may fear that a Spiritual <hi>Famine</hi> will be our Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and no Place left for Repentance, no Bleſſing remaining for us, though we ſeek it <hi>earneſtly with Tears.</hi> As the Prodigal in the Parable, when, after he had waſted his Subſtance in riotous Living, and then <hi>want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and was ready to periſh with Hunger, ſo that he would have been glad of the

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another</hi> ill Conſequence of this Spiritual Prodigality, and looſe wicked Courſe of Life (and to name no more amongſt a numerous Train of them) is, that it extreamly degrades and <hi>debaſes</hi> a Man, and engages him in the <hi>vileſt</hi> Drudgery imaginable, the ſerving <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Luſts,</hi> and <hi>Deviliſh Paſſions.</hi> This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in the Parable by the <hi>Prodigal</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent into the Feilds to <hi>feed Swine;</hi> a thing the moſt <hi>abject</hi> in it <hi>ſelf,</hi> and the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable to the <hi>Jews</hi> (to whom our Lord ſpake the Parable) who were taught by their Law to eſteem that Creature among the moſt <hi>unclean.</hi> And as low or <hi>lower</hi> than this does he debaſe his Nature, who, neglecting the <hi>Noble</hi> Precepts of <hi>Religion,</hi> makes his <hi>Senſual</hi> Appetite the Rule and Meaſure of his Actions. For what more <hi>Beaſtly</hi> and Deteſtable than <hi>ungovern'd Luſt?</hi> The wretch himſelf that is guilty of it is aſham'd <hi>publickly</hi> to commit it, and takes Advantage of Holes and Corners, and the Night to hide his abominable Wickedneſs, and his own <hi>Bluſhes</hi> that attend the Commiſſion of it</p>
            <p>What puts a Man upon more pittiful and <hi>unmanly</hi> Shifts to attain his Deſire? What ſneaking and cringing to a baſe Strumpet, and her baſer Servants, before Acceſs can be had to a Neighbours Bed, or a Virgin Innocence defil'd?</p>
            <pb n="380" facs="tcp:103289:204"/>
            <p>And as much may be ſaid of the Shame of <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> that <hi>Swiniſh</hi> Vice, which makes a Man more vile and deſpicable than the fouleſt of Brutes. 'Tis a Vice every Way odious and unmanly, and full of the moſt deteſtable Conſequences, and branded with the <hi>baſeſt</hi> Character, even by <hi>Infidels:</hi> And ſo of all other Senſual Vices, the Shame and Baſeneſs is notorious.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Deviliſh Paſſions</hi> likewiſe, to which Men become ſubject that throw off the Government of Religion, ſuch as <hi>pride, Vain-Glory and Hypocriſy, Envy, Hatred and Malice,</hi> and ſuch like; do greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file our excellent Nature, and are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Diſparagement to thoſe that ſuffer their Minds to be infeſted with them; as would be ſoon apparent, could we but perſwade them to ſo much Seriouſneſs as to recollect with themſelves how odious theſe Vices have appear'd when they have met with them in <hi>other</hi> Men. And if they look ſo ill in <hi>others,</hi> certainly no Man can be ſo beſotted as to think them <hi>amiable</hi> Qualifications in <hi>himſelf;</hi> but muſt confeſs, that whoever is ſo fooliſhly prodigal as to waſte and ſquander away what is of <hi>real</hi> Excellency, as <hi>Vertue</hi> is in the Eyes of all Men, and gives himſelf up to ſuch Deviliſh Paſſion as thoſe before mention'd, and the Service of ſuch vile Luſts; Debaſes himſelf much lower than that vile Office of ſerving the vileſt of Brutes. Great Reaſon therefore have ſuch Men ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to bethink themſelves, and attend to the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:103289:204"/>Remorſe of their Conſciences, which goes along with ſuch Courſes, and being once awaken'd, reſolve to return again to their Obedience to God. Which is the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> thing expreſs'd in this Parable, by the Prodigal Son's <hi>coming to himſelf,</hi> and thus reaſoning. <hi>How many hired Servants of my Father's have Bread enough and to ſpare, and I periſh with Hunger! I will ariſe and go to my Father, and will ſay unto him, Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be call'd thy Son, make me as one of thy hired Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Miſery,</hi> and <hi>Shame,</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways tread cloſe at the Heels of <hi>Wickedneſs;</hi> and indeed, ſo <hi>much</hi> Miſery and Shame, as Sin is the Occaſion of, muſt needs make any Man that <hi>conſiders</hi> and is not <hi>hardned</hi> in his Iniquity, to repent and be <hi>ſorry</hi> that ever he committed it. <hi>When ye were the Servants of Sin,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6.20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>ye were free from Righteouſneſs;</hi> ye had what ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and liv'd without God and Religion in the World, and were a Law unto your ſelves (as the Prodigal, weary of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Inſpection over him, deſir'd his Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and went into a far Country, and there liv'd riotouſly and without Controul) <hi>But what Fruit had ye of thoſe things whereof ye are now aſham'd? For the End of theſe things is Death.</hi> And this the young Prodigal found too true likewiſe by a ſad Experience, and waſted what he had and was ready to periſh with Hunger, and glad to ſubmit to the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:103289:205"/>baſeſt Servitude for Suſtenance, and at laſt was fain, with much <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> to return to his Father, and humbly confeſs his Folly and Unworthineſs to be call'd any more his <hi>Son,</hi> and deſir'd only the Favour of being made as one of his hired Servants. The Works of Darkneſs, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, are always <hi>unfruitful</hi> of any thing that is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſatisfying</hi> and good; but bring forth <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars</hi> and <hi>Thorns</hi> in Abundance, many Troubles and Vexations, wherewith to tear and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the miſerable ſinful Soul.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider a little more <hi>particularly</hi> this <hi>Reſolution</hi> of the Prodigal to return to his Father, and <hi>when</hi> it was that he took it up.</p>
            <p>The Parable ſays, he made this Reſolution, <hi>when he came to himſelf,</hi> and conſidered how many of his Father's <hi>hired Servants</hi> had Bread enough, and to ſpare, while he that was his <hi>Son</hi> was ready to <hi>periſh with Hunger.</hi>

               </q> For what Man of a <hi>ſound</hi> Mind would act ſo ſtrangely and make ſuch diſadvantagious Choices, as a <hi>Sinner</hi> does? Who with his

            </p>
            <p>In this <hi>moral</hi> Frenzie was the Prodigal in the Parable, when he left his <hi>Father</hi> and waſted his Subſtance afar off in Exceſs of Riot; till at length the ſad <hi>Conſequences</hi> of his Extravagancy, brought him again to his Reaſon; and when he <hi>came to himſelf,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to <hi>ariſe and return to his Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A Man's <hi>coming to himſelf,</hi> in a Religious Senſe, is the making <hi>uſe</hi> of his <hi>Reaſon</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the paſt Errors and Miſcarriages of his Life; in conſidering the many ſad <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences</hi> of Vice, and the great <hi>Obligation</hi> we have upon all Accounts to live <hi>religiouſly,</hi> and fully purpoſing upon ſuch Conſideration,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:103289:206"/>to break off all evil Courſes, and live for the Future as becomes <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> For a Man is never more <hi>himſelf,</hi> than when he exerciſes his Reaſon upon the beſt of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>Religion;</hi> and conſiders how he may beſt conform himſelf to the Holy Rules of Chriſtianity, and purpoſes to do according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And he that ſuffers himſelf to be hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by impetuous Paſſions and unruly Luſts, to commit vile Actions, and neglects to make uſe of his Reaſon to govern and keep in <hi>order</hi> his Affections, acts more like a <hi>Brute</hi> than a <hi>Man,</hi> and is not yet <hi>come to himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſideration is indeed the <hi>Life</hi> of both <hi>ſpeculative</hi> and <hi>practical</hi> Religion; and then 'tis, that Men <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>live amiſs,</hi> when they ceaſe to <hi>conſider</hi> as they ought. For, there is ſo much of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> in the things a Chriſtian is to <hi>believe;</hi> and the things he is to <hi>do,</hi> are ſo <hi>excellent</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo conducive to <hi>intire</hi> Happineſs both here and hereafter; that no Man, that <hi>duly</hi> conſiders and <hi>attends</hi> to either, but will be powerfully inclin'd to <hi>aſſent</hi> to the one, and <hi>practiſe</hi> the other, and be no longer an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel or Heretick, or live a vicious irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Life.</p>
            <p>'Twas <hi>Conſideration</hi> made the Prodigal Son reſolve to return to his Father, and humble himſelf before him; and could the Sinners of this Age be perſwaded ſeriouſly to <hi>conſider</hi> and <hi>weigh</hi> things together, they would ſoon ſee Reaſon enough to convince them that 'tis
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:103289:206"/>their wiſeſt Courſe to live at another Rate than formerly, and put an End to their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances by Repentance.</p>
            <p>But <hi>what</hi> did this Prodigal conſider when he came to himſelf, that ſo powerfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd him to return to his Father with ſuch an humble and ſhameful Confeſſion of his Extravagancy? 'Twas <hi>this; How many of my Father's hired Servants have Bread enough and to ſpare, and I periſh with Hunger?</hi> He found by a woful Experience, that however uneaſie 'twas to him formerly to be under his Father's Eye, and in Subjection to his Commands; 'twas by far a happier Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than that, which by his Prodigality he was then reduc'd to: The meaneſt of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's <hi>Servants</hi> was in happier Circumſtances than <hi>he,</hi> and therefore he thought it his wiſeſt Courſe to ariſe and return to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And ſo would it be with a Sinner, would he but <hi>compare</hi> a Virtuous and Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Courſe of Life together. He would find by his own ſad Experience if he would but attend to it, that all his Extravagances, from which at firſt he expected to reap ſo much Happineſs, are not only <hi>Vanity,</hi> empty and unſatisfying, but likewiſe <hi>Vexation of Spirit;</hi> full of Troubles and Misfortunes, attended with Shame and Diſgrace, inward <hi>Remorſe</hi> and Gripings of Conſcience, and dire Forbodings of the Wrath to come. And this would ſoon convince him of the much greater Happineſs of Obedience and Submiſſion to the Will of God; for that has
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:103289:207"/>
               <hi>none</hi> of all this Miſery, but <hi>Peace</hi> of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, inward <hi>Contentment</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Mind, and the comfortable Expectation of Eternal Happineſs in the Preſence of God. And the <hi>Concluſion</hi> of ſuch Conſiderations, would be, his Reſolution to ariſe and go to his Heavenly Father, and with much Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſincere Contrition ſay unto him, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I have ſinned againſt Heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be call'd thy Son, make me as one of thy hired Servants.</hi> And indeed, the pooreſt good Man that is a diligent and faithful Servant of God, is in an infinitely happier Condition than the greateſt <hi>wicked</hi> Prince; he experiences more true Happineſs even in this World, and when he ſhall hear the joyful Sound at the Day of Judgment, <hi>Well done good and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, enter into the Joy of thy Lord,</hi> and wicked Emperors be thruſt away, with <hi>I know you not, depart from me ye Workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi> then ſhall all the World <hi>diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the righteous and the wicked, between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not:</hi> The <hi>former</hi> ſhall have <hi>Bread enough, and to ſpare,</hi> their Happineſs ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and <hi>full;</hi> while the <hi>latter</hi> ſhall periſh with a keen Hunger after what they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoy, and for ever be ſent <hi>empty away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Prodigal had <hi>conſider'd</hi> himſelf into a Reſolution of <hi>returning</hi> to his Father, he put his Reſolution into <hi>practice,</hi> and aroſe and <hi>came</hi> to his Father, and ſaid, <hi>Father, I have ſinned,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="387" facs="tcp:103289:207"/>
            <p>And truly, 'tis not bare <hi>reſolving</hi> that is ſufficient to Amendment of Life; we muſt <hi>act</hi> agreeably, and that <hi>immediately</hi> too, or elſe our Reſolutions, though never ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly made, will vaniſh into <hi>nothing,</hi> and the Breach of them ſtill more increaſe our <hi>Guilt.</hi> For, when a Man has proceeded ſo far towards a new Life, as to <hi>reſolve</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake every Evil Way, and no longer to inſiſt in his former Vile Courſes; 'tis a ſign that his Soul is rous'd and <hi>awaken'd</hi> from its ſpiritual Sleep, that his Eyes are <hi>open'd,</hi> and that he <hi>diſcerns</hi> his Error; and if after all this, he <hi>ſtill</hi> perſiſts in it, he then ſins againſt clear <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which is the higheſt Aggravation of a Fault.</p>
            <p>As a Sinner therefore ſhould, as ſoon as he is become ſenſible of his Sin, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <hi>reſolve</hi> to <hi>forſake</hi> it, and return to his Obedience to God; ſo muſt he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put his Reſolution into Practice: for otherwiſe, he does but mock God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his own Soul, and will only increaſe his Damnation. A well-grounded Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a good <hi>Preparative</hi> to Amendment, but 'tis but a <hi>Preparative;</hi> and to <hi>reſolve</hi> to do a Thing, and <hi>actually</hi> to do it, are two very different Things. We all of us, I hope, that pretend to be Chriſtians, ſo far conſider, as to grieve and be aſham'd for having offended our Good God; and are at <hi>that</hi> inſtant reſolv'd never willingly to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs his Holy Will again: Let us but <hi>keep</hi> our Reſolutions, and we ſhall be Happy;
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:103289:208"/>for, ſuch as with the Prodigal, <hi>actually</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their Heavenly Father, and humble themſelves before him, he is ready, with the greateſt Expreſſions of Kindneſs, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to his Favour. Which brings me to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſt</hi> Thing expreſs'd in this Parable; <hi>(viz.)</hi> The great Tenderneſs and Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Father of Spirits to ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in earneſt, and perform their Reſolves of Amendment; his Readineſs to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to them, and extraordinary Joy for their Return, <hi>becauſe they were dead but are alive again, were loſt but are found.</hi> For ſo 'tis ſaid in the Parable, That when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Prodigal was yet <hi>a great way off, his Father ſaw him, and had Compaſſion, and ran, and fell on his Neck, and kiſſed him, and ſaid to his Servants, Bring forth the beſt Robe, and put it on him, and put a Ring on his Hand, and Shooes on his Feet, and bring hither the fatted Galf, and kill it, and let us eat and be merry.</hi>

            <p>While he was <hi>yet a great way off,</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had <hi>Compaſſion, and ran to meet him.</hi> By this is expreſs'd God's great Deſire that a Sinner's Repentance ſhould be <hi>compleated;</hi> he will <hi>meet</hi> him, and that with more than ordinary Aſſiſtances of his Spirit, leſt any Temptation ſhould ſo far prevail as to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi> his Return, and make him <hi>change</hi> or <hi>defer</hi> to put in <hi>practice,</hi> that good Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had taken up. He <hi>prevents</hi> a <hi>real</hi> Penitent with the Riches of his Grace, and
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:103289:208"/>while he is yet a <hi>great way off,</hi> labouring with the Difficulties that attend a thorough Change of Life; he, with infinite Charity and Compaſſion, comes forth to <hi>meet</hi> him, that by his Divine Aid he may ſecure his Retreat from the Endeavours of the Devil and his own vile Affections, to bring him back to his former vain and wicked Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which by God's Grace he has reſolved to break off by Repentance.</p>
            <p>And when a Sinner's Repentance is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated,</hi> and he is actually return'd with Shame and Sorrow to his Heavenly Father; what <hi>rejoycing</hi> is there! With what endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kindneſs does the Divine Goodneſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a miſerable ſelf-condemn'd Wretch, that ſees his Error, is aſham'd and griev'd for it, and returns with hearty Purpoſe to obey him better! 'Tis repreſented in the Parable, by the higheſt Expreſſions of Joy that were in thoſe Eaſtern Countries; the Prodigal's Father <hi>ran to meet him, fell on his Neck, and kiſſed him, commanded the beſt Robe to be put on him, and a Ring on his Hand, and Shooes on his Feet, and made mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with Feaſting, and Muſick, and Dancing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One would have thought, his wild Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy ſhould have met with rougher Entertainment, at leaſt at <hi>firſt</hi> Interview; and <hi>Reproof</hi> have been given to his <hi>Folly,</hi> which brought him to ſo much <hi>Miſery.</hi> But his Father's Compaſſion was above his Anger; and becauſe he whom he thought was <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>loſt,</hi> was <hi>alive</hi> again and <hi>found,</hi>
               <pb n="390" facs="tcp:103289:209"/>he forgot all <hi>Reſentment,</hi> and embraced him with Tenderneſs and Endearment. And thus it is with God when he ſees a Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinner: Though the Sinner has indeed deſerved nothing but the Expreſſes of his Wrath and Indignation, and to be for ever <hi>rejected</hi> by him; yet he who gives freely to every man, and upbraideth not, and whoſe Mercy is over all his Works, <hi>will not break the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoaking Flax;</hi> but in infinite Goodneſs, not only give <hi>Admittance</hi> to, but receive with <hi>joy</hi> his Returning Prodigals.</p>
            <p>And how can we enough praiſe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire theſe Wonders of the Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and Love, to poor miſerable and polluted Creatures! 'Tis an Abyſs that can never be fathom'd; our Thoughts are loſt and ſwallow'd up in the Contemplation of it, and <hi>ſilent Admiration</hi> does beſt expreſs that which <hi>no Words</hi> can reach.</p>
            <p>And now, for a Concluſion of the whole; Since Vice and a <hi>Lawleſs</hi> Courſe of Living, is the Parent of ſo much Miſery, and has ſo many ill Conſequences cloſely attending it even in <hi>this</hi> World, and is, as the moſt <hi>extravagant,</hi> ſo the moſt <hi>unhappy Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> and ſince the Miſeries of a wicked Life <hi>here,</hi> are but the Beginnings of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable and <hi>eternal</hi> Sorrows <hi>hereafter;</hi> and ſince there is but <hi>one</hi> Cure for this great Evil, and nothing but ſincere <hi>Repentance</hi> will ſave us from Deſtruction; and ſince God is ſo infinitely good, as greatly to <hi>deſire</hi> we would
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:103289:209"/>Repent, and return to our Obedience to him, and affords us all poſſible Helps in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it, and greatly <hi>rejoyces</hi> to ſee a Sinner <hi>penitent,</hi> and receives him with the higheſt Expreſſions of <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> ſince all this is ſo, let us put off no longer, what, if we would be happy, muſt be done at laſt; but, with the greateſt Thankfulneſs, embrace the ineſtimable Favour of being again receiv'd into the Arms of our merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God and Saviour. Let us immediately turn from every Evil Way; and that we may do ſo <hi>effectually,</hi> let us lay to heart how <hi>vexatious,</hi> and full of <hi>Shame,</hi> and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>unprofitable</hi> a wicked Courſe of Life is, and how full of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and unſpeakable <hi>Delight</hi> it is to advance from Grace to Grace, and to <hi>perfect Holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> And having <hi>reſolv'd</hi> well, and fully purpoſed our Return to the wiſe and good Government of our Heavenly Father, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Delay <hi>do</hi> as we have <hi>reſolv'd,</hi> and ariſe and go to our Father, and ſay, with all Humility and Confuſion of Face, and ſincere Contrition, <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son;</hi> and he whoſe Compaſſions never fail, will embrace us with the Arms of his Mercy, and forget our former Provocations, and take us to his Favour and Protection in this World, and at length make us Partakers of the Joys of his <hi>Heavenly Kingdom;</hi> where there ſhall be Rejoycing in his Preſence for our

                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Luke xvi. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.</hi>

                  <p>There was a certain Rich Man, which was clothed in Purple and Fine Linnen, and fared ſumptuouſly every day;</p>
                  <p>And there was a certain Beggar named <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which was laid at his Gate, full of Sores,</p>
                  <p>And deſiring to be fed with the Crumbs which fell from the Rich Man's Table: moreover, the Dogs came and licked his Sores.</p>
                  <p>And it came to paſs that the Beggar died, and was carried by the Angels into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom: the Rich Man alſo died, and was buried.</p>
                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:103289:212"/>
                  <p>And in Hell he lift up his Eyes, being in Torments, and ſeeth <hi>Abraham</hi> afar off, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his Boſom.</p>
                  <p>And he cried and ſaid, Father <hi>Abraham</hi> have mercy on me, and ſend <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that he may dip the tip of his finger in Water, and cool my Tongue, for I am tormented in this Flame.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, Son remember, that thou in thy life-time received'ſt thy good Things, and likewiſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> evil Things: but now, He is comforted, and Thou art tormented.</p>
                  <p>And beſides all this, between <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s and You there is a great Gulf fixed, ſo that they which would paſs from hence to you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, neither can they paſs to us that would come from thence.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS Parable ſeems to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to inform us of <hi>Three</hi> Things:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That from a Man's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous or Adverſe Condition in <hi>this</hi> World, there is no Judgment to be made concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Condition in the <hi>next;</hi> and that 'tis not ſeldom that the <hi>Happineſs</hi> Men meet with in <hi>this</hi> Life, is changed for <hi>Miſery</hi> in the <hi>other,</hi> and that <hi>Affliction</hi> here ends in Happineſs hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That whatever Alteration is made in the State and Condition of the Soul, after its <hi>Departure</hi> from this World, ſhall be from thenceforth for ever <hi>unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That every Man may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>aſſur'd</hi> of this that reads the Scriptures and powerfully enough inclin'd to <hi>avoid</hi> that Future <hi>Miſery,</hi> and ſecure his Eternal <hi>Happineſs;</hi> without any more <hi>extraordinary</hi> Ways of Conviction of the <hi>Truth</hi> of this, and <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> to act accordingly: And that thoſe who are not <hi>ſatisfied</hi> with what has been <hi>hitherto</hi> reveal'd in this Matter, will <hi>never</hi> be ſatisfied, though One ſhould come from the Dead to aſſure them of it. Of each of theſe Particulars I ſhall diſcourſe in their Order.</p>
            <pb n="398" facs="tcp:103289:213" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> thing this Parable informs us of is, that from a Man's proſperous or adverſe Condition in <hi>this</hi> World, there is no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be made concerning his Condition in the <hi>next;</hi> and that 'tis not ſeldom, that the Happineſs Men meet with in this Life, is chang'd for Miſery in the other; and on the contrary, that Affliction Here ends in Happineſs Hereafter. And this is expreſs'd in the Parable by a Poor <hi>Beggar,</hi> that was full of Sores, and begg'd but the Crums that fell from a Rich Man's Table, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried <hi>by Angels into Abraham's Boſom</hi> when he died, or received into that Place of Happineſs which is prepar'd for them that live and dye in the Faith and Fear of God, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did; while the Rich Man that was cloath'd in Purple and fine Linnen, and fared ſumptuouſly every day, after <hi>he</hi> dy'd was <hi>Tormented in the flames of Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas the <hi>Obſervation</hi> and <hi>Complaint</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and might have been made (if it was not) long before, even from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of the World, that no Man knoweth either the Love or Hatred of God, by All that is here in <hi>this</hi> World before him; nay, that there are <hi>Juſt</hi> Men to whom it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth according to the Work of the <hi>Wicked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 9.1.</note> and <hi>Wicked</hi> Men to whom it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth according to the Work of the <hi>Righteous; i. e.</hi> That <hi>Wicked</hi> Men are often obſerv'd to be <hi>proſperous</hi> here, as if they were the <hi>Favourites</hi> of Heaven, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for their Vertue, and <hi>Good</hi> Men
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:103289:213"/>
               <hi>calamitous</hi> and afflicted, as if they were <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> of God, and puniſh'd for their great Impieties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> makes a very pathetical Complaint to this purpoſe, and was indeed,

               <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 73.21.</note> likewiſe, very feelingly complain'd of this, and the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Jer. 12.1.</note>; and indeed, this ſo ſeemingly ſtrange Method of Providence is the <hi>Obſervation</hi> of <hi>every Man,</hi> and the <hi>Wonder</hi> of <hi>moſt.</hi> And what <hi>Concluſions</hi> Men will be apt to draw from ſuch Obſervations, is eaſie to imagine. The <hi>Beſt</hi> of Men will be apt to be <hi>diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,</hi> and tempted to ſay with <hi>David, Verily, I have cleanſed my Heart in vain, and waſh'd my Hands in Innocency:</hi> And as for <hi>Sinners,</hi> no doubt but they will be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden'd by it to <hi>ſtrengthen themſelves in their Wickedneſs;</hi> and either perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that their Actions are <hi>not</hi> ſo <hi>odious</hi> in the Sight of God as has been repreſented to them; or that, becauſe they Thrive and <hi>Proſper</hi> more than <hi>Better Men,</hi> the Threats of Religion are but <hi>Scare-Crows,</hi> and becauſe not <hi>ſpeedily,</hi> ſhall <hi>never</hi> be inflicted; or, if there <hi>be</hi> another World, that they ſhall fare as well in <hi>that</hi> as they have done in this. And the more <hi>indifferent</hi> ſort of Men, that are neither very Bad nor very Good, if they <hi>proſper</hi> here, will be apt to think it is an Argument of God's <hi>Favour</hi> to them, that they perform an acceptable Service to him <hi>now,</hi> and that it ſhall therefore be well with them hereafter; and if they do <hi>not</hi> Thrive, they will be inclined to follow the Courſe of thoſe that <hi>do,</hi> as looking upon <hi>Proſperity</hi> to be an Argument of the <hi>Favour and Bleſſing of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="401" facs="tcp:103289:214"/>
            <p>But <hi>All</hi> this is <hi>throughout</hi> a great and <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous</hi> Miſtake; and Worldly <hi>Proſperity</hi> is neither a certain Argument of God's <hi>Favour</hi> to Men in <hi>this</hi> World, or of their <hi>Happineſs</hi> in the <hi>next:</hi> Neither is <hi>Affliction</hi> a certain Sign of God's <hi>caſting Men off</hi> here, or a ſure Forerunner of <hi>Eternal Miſery</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; but frequently on the <hi>contrary,</hi> the <hi>Good</hi> are <hi>calamitous</hi> in this World, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom in the other, and thoſe that are Proſperous and <hi>Happy</hi> here, too often have their Portion in the <hi>Flames of Hell</hi> hereafter.</p>
            <p>Proſperity is in it ſelf indeed a <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> and promis'd as a Part of the Reward of Godlineſs; and accordingly, many good Men are Happy even here; and were <hi>All</hi> truly <hi>good, All</hi> would be Proſperous and <hi>Happy;</hi> for 'tis <hi>Sin</hi> only that makes the World <hi>miſerable:</hi> And on the other ſide, Affliction is <hi>in it ſelf</hi> a great Evil, and by <hi>no means joyous but grievous,</hi> and is always the Puniſhment of ſome <hi>Offence.</hi> But, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes Worldly <hi>Proſperity</hi> is ſent as a <hi>Curſe</hi> rather than a <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> and is the Effect of God's Diſpleaſure, and the <hi>only</hi> Happineſs that ſome ſhall e'er enjoy.

            <p>And indeed, it is no wonder that it ſhould be ſo, and that <hi>Proſperity</hi> in <hi>this</hi> World ſhould ſo often end in <hi>Miſery</hi> in the <hi>next,</hi> and the <hi>Afflictions</hi> Men meet with <hi>here,</hi> be turn'd into <hi>Happineſs hereafter.</hi> For World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Proſperity, however <hi>charming</hi> it may <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi> to us, is a State ſo full of <hi>Dangers,</hi> ſo beſet with <hi>Temptations to Vice,</hi> ſo apt to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Men from attending to Things of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater moment, and laying up a Treaſure in Heaven; and <hi>Adverſity</hi> on the contrary, though very <hi>uneaſie</hi> to <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> yet is ſo apt therefore to <hi>wean</hi> Men from the World, and the fading Vanities of it, and make them out of Love with what is ſo <hi>fickle</hi> and uncertain, and full of Trouble; and is a State that <hi>humbles</hi> Men much, and increaſes <hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>Truſt in God,</hi> and puts 'em upon Repentance, and a Deſire of enjoying that <hi>Heavenly</hi> Treaſure which ſhall never be taken from them:
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:103289:215"/>That for a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, ſeems by far the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Difficulty, and more likelihood is there of the <hi>Calamities</hi> of this World bringing a Man to that happy Place, than the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enjoyment of its <hi>Pleaſures.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Not many Rich, not many Mighty are called,</hi> and <hi>that Riches are a Temptation and a Snare, and drown Men in divers hurtful Luſts, and bring them to Deſtruction and Perdition;</hi> and therefore exhorts Men to <hi>count it all Joy when they fall into divers Temptations</hi> or Afflictions.</p>
            <p>The Uſe then, that we may make of this firſt Part of the Parable, is this; not to be <hi>dejected</hi> under <hi>Adverſity,</hi> as if <hi>caſt off</hi> by God, and utterly depriv'd of his Favour, nor <hi>puff'd up</hi> by <hi>Proſperity,</hi> as if <hi>peculiarly dear</hi> to Heaven; but in every State to make it our greateſt Care and Endeavour to ſecure our <hi>main</hi> Intereſt, and with Fear and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, in the one Condition as well as the other, to work out our Salvation, by the Practice of that <hi>Holineſs,</hi> without which <hi>no Man,</hi> whether Rich or Poor, Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous or Proſperous, <hi>ſhall ſee the Lord;</hi> and <hi>with</hi> which <hi>any</hi> Man, in whatſoever Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances he is <hi>in this Life,</hi> ſhall be ſure of a glorious Eternity in the <hi>Preſence</hi> and <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of his <hi>Maker.</hi> If Riches increaſe by honeſt Induſtry, and conſcientious Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and prudent Management, we ought to eſteem it as a <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> and humbly thank God for it; but by no means ſhould we

               <hi>ſet our Hearts</hi> upon them, nor grow high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, and conceited of our ſelves, as if greatly in Favour and Eſteem of God, and our Proſperity the Reward of our extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Vertue; nor <hi>deſpiſe</hi> the Poverty of others, looking upon them as leſs <hi>Holy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not ſo <hi>proſperous</hi> as we.

What Comfort had the Rich Man in the Parable of all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Proſperity, when he lay weltring in the Flames of Hell? All his <hi>Purple</hi> and Fine Linnen, and Sumptuous Fare, becauſe he abus'd 'em to Luxury and Exceſs, and grew negligent of laying up a Treaſure of <hi>good Works</hi> in <hi>Heaven;</hi> ended at length in the Want of a Drop of Water to cool his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd Tongue.</p>

            <p>If <hi>Affliction</hi> and <hi>Poverty</hi> ſhould be our Lot, 'tis then our Duty to endeavour to be <hi>contented,</hi> and not deſpond as if utterly <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected</hi> of God, but to remember that there is a <hi>better</hi> World, in which thoſe ſhall be unſpeakably and for ever happy, that are patient and <hi>reſign'd</hi> in this Vally of the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death; that the Lord <hi>loveth</hi> whom he <hi>chaſteneth,</hi> and that if we comply with the <hi>Ends</hi> of his Correction, and amend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Paternal Rod, <hi>our light Affliction, which is but for a Moment, ſhall work for us a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory. Lazarus</hi> in the Parable, we read, was miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably poor, deſirous, though but of the <hi>Fragments</hi> that <hi>fell from</hi> the Rich Man's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and full of noiſom painful Sores, a ſad Spectacle both to himſelf and others; and yet, when he died, was carried up by <hi>Angels</hi> into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Boſom.</hi> 'Tis not a Man's <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Circumſtances that God reſpects, but the inward <hi>Temper</hi> of his <hi>Mind,</hi> and often makes his <hi>outward</hi> Condition <hi>calamitous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 16.7.</note> that his <hi>Mind</hi> may grow <hi>better;</hi> and if a Man be as poor and deſpicable in the Eye of the World as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> yet if he is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented <hi>reſign'd</hi> Soul, and make it his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be <hi>rich towards God;</hi> he at length ſhall be fill'd with <hi>Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory,</hi> while many <hi>rich</hi> that have their Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>this</hi> Life ſhall be <hi>ſent empty away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much for the <hi>firſt</hi> thing this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable informs us of, namely, that from a Man's proſperous or adverſe Condition in
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:103289:217"/>
               <hi>this</hi> World, there is no Judgment to be made concerning his final Condition in the <hi>next.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> thing it informs us of is, that whatever Change is made in the Condition of the Soul, after its <hi>Departure</hi> from this World, its State ſhall be from thenceforth for ever <hi>unalterable.</hi> For ſo in the Parable, when the Rich Man being in Torments, lifted up his Eyes, and ſaw <hi>Abraham afar off,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus in his Boſom,</hi> and cry'd and ſaid, <hi>Father</hi> Abraham <hi>have Mercy on me, and ſend</hi> Lazarus <hi>that he may dip the Tip of his Finger in Water and cool my Tongue, for I am tormented in this Flame; Abraham,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had told him that <hi>he</hi> had in his <hi>Life-Time</hi> receiv'd his good things, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> his evil, things, and that then there was a great and unexpected Change, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> was comforted and he tormented; he adds, moreover, that between him and them there was a <hi>great Gulf fix'd,</hi> ſo that thoſe which would paſs from thence to him could not, neither could any paſs from him to them.</p>
            <p>What is meant by this <hi>Gulf fixed</hi> between Heaven and Hell, which hinders any <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or Relief</hi> coming from thence to that miſerable Place, or any Trouble or Annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from that Place to Heaven; ſo that the Condition both of the Wicked and the Righteous, remains unchangeably <hi>happy</hi> or <hi>miſerable</hi> reſpectively: Has been much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, eſpecially amongſt the School-men.
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:103289:217"/>But it tending to very little Edification to relate their Opinions, moſt of which are very frivolous; I ſhall only ſay what is the moſt receiv'd Opinion in our Church. By the <hi>Gulf</hi> fixed, we ſuppoſe is only meant God's irreverſible Decree that thoſe whoſe Wickedneſſes made them incapable of the Viſion and Enjoyment of God, and ſunk them down to Hell, ſhall for ever remain there without any Hopes of Comfort or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and that the <hi>Righteous</hi> likewiſe ſhall be receiv'd into <hi>Life</hi> and Happineſs <hi>everlaſting,</hi> and ſuch as all the Powers of Hell ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to leſſen or diſturb. And this methinks to any ſenſible Man, ſhould appear to be an Opinion the moſt reaſonable and moſt agreeable to the Holy Writings. Now here 'twill be worth our while, ſince the rich Man's Puniſhment is expreſs'd by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tormented in Flame, and doom'd to be for <hi>ever</hi> ſo, to ſatisfie two Queries uſually put in this Caſe; as <hi>firſt,</hi> Why the Torments of Hell are expreſs'd by Flames and Burning? And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> How it can be conſiſtent with the Divine Juſtice to puniſh the <hi>tranſient</hi> Acts of Sin, with ſuch an <hi>endleſs</hi> Miſery?</p>
            <p>To the <hi>firſt</hi> I return this Anſwer as to me the moſt ſatisfactory. Though I believe that at the general Conflagration, when the Heavens ſhall be ſhrunk up as a ſcorch'd Parchment, and the Elements melt with fervent Heat, and the World and all that's in it be burn'd up; though I believe that God will then take Vengeance of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:103289:218"/>in <hi>real</hi> Flames of Fire, which ſhall for ever encircle and prey upon their Bodies: yet I think, <hi>that</hi> will be the <hi>leaſt</hi> Part of their Torment, and that the <hi>Extremity</hi> of it will conſiſt in the <hi>inward</hi> Trouble of their <hi>Minds;</hi> ariſing from an <hi>impatient Appetite,</hi> and continual <hi>Thirſt</hi> after that <hi>Felicity,</hi> which they know, through their <hi>own Default,</hi> they ſhall <hi>never</hi> come to <hi>enjoy.</hi> And that ſuch <hi>vehement Deſires,</hi> and the Paſſions conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon the <hi>diſappointment</hi> of them, ſhould be call'd <hi>Flames</hi> and <hi>Burning,</hi> is no more than what is uſual in our common Manner of ſpeaking; and the Expreſſion of <hi>fervent</hi> and <hi>ardent</hi> Deſires, is often met with in the holy writings too, particularly, where <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>My Soul breaketh out with the very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent deſire it hath always to thy Commandments.</hi> And Rage, and Fury, and Impatience, and the like, which attend <hi>unſatisfied</hi> Deſires, are likewiſe frequently attended with the Epithet of <hi>Fire;</hi> as every one muſt needs have obſerv'd.</p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Man</hi> having an <hi>innate uncontrola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thirſt</hi> after <hi>Happineſs,</hi> and which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways equally intenſe, and that to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Degree; when, (as the Puniſhment of his Rebellion againſt God, his fooliſh and wicked Choices here, his Purſuit after <hi>low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> Good, and Neglect of the <hi>ſupreme</hi>) he ſhall be <hi>for ever</hi> baniſh'd to an infinite Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not only from the <hi>Fountain</hi> of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, but from every <hi>Stream</hi> and <hi>Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it (which here below <hi>cool'd</hi> his Heat
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:103289:218"/>a litle, and for the <hi>preſent</hi> gratified that his Deſire) and yet the Appetite and <hi>Thirſt</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it continuing as great as ever, and the Wretch withal ſenſible of the <hi>utter Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of attaining it; and that, not ſo much as <hi>one Drop</hi> from that Fountain of Bliſs ſhall ever be given to allay his Thirſt, and cool his parch'd and inflam'd Tongue: His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire muſt for ever be to the higheſt Degree craving and <hi>importunate</hi> in <hi>vain;</hi> and being continually thus <hi>diſappointed,</hi> his <hi>Impatience</hi> will ſtill grow hotter and hotter, and his Remorſe for bringing this upon <hi>himſelf,</hi> turning to eternal <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Fury,</hi> and boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up like Rivers of enflam'd Brimſtone, the <hi>Fire</hi> will be <hi>everlaſting.</hi> And what a Calenture, think we, will the whole Man be in; when <hi>without</hi> the fierceſt <hi>material</hi> Flames ſhall prey upon the <hi>Body,</hi> and hotter Fires <hi>within</hi> torment the <hi>Soul!</hi> And this Notion of the <hi>Flames</hi> of Hell, ſeems to me not obſcurely hinted, in the Rich Man's lifting up his Eyes in his Torment, and when he ſaw the happy State of <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Boſom, begging him to impart, though but <hi>one Drop</hi> of that Bliſs he enjoy'd, to cool <hi>his</hi> parched Tongue. His Deſire of that Happineſs was <hi>in</hi> the greateſt Degree of <hi>Ardency,</hi> and when he ſaw <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, <hi>then</hi> he cry'd out, Father <hi>Abraham</hi> have Mercy on me, for I am tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in this <hi>Flame.</hi> Thus much for the <hi>firſt</hi> Query. To the <hi>ſecond</hi> I return this in Brief; That ſince <hi>Sin</hi> is the <hi>greateſt Poſſible
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:103289:219"/>Evil,</hi> (it being a Violation of the <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> Tyes and <hi>Obligations,</hi> an Oppoſition and <hi>Contrariety</hi> to the <hi>Supreme Good,</hi> and in <hi>no</hi> Caſe <hi>eligible,</hi> as every conſidering Man muſt needs confeſs) it can't be too rigorouſly dealt with, even by the Infliction of the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poſſible Puniſhment;</hi> for there is the ſame Proportion between the <hi>greateſt Evil</hi> and the <hi>greateſt Puniſhment,</hi> as between a <hi>leſſer Evil</hi> and a <hi>leſſer Puniſhment:</hi> And therefore, unleſs we'll ſay, there can <hi>never</hi> be any Proportion between a Fault and its Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I think we muſt own, there <hi>is</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion <hi>here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Uſe we may make of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part of the Parable is this. That, ſince the Conſequence of a Life of Wickedneſs, is ſo <hi>dreadful</hi> and <hi>remedileſs</hi> a Ruin, and the Wages of Sin this <hi>eternal</hi> Torment and Death; we would be above all things care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to <hi>avoid</hi> this Place of everlaſting Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and make uſe of our Time and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity while we have it, in providing for a <hi>happy</hi> Eternity. The End of every Man's <hi>Life</hi> is the Beginning of Eternity to <hi>him;</hi> then <hi>Time</hi> ſhall be no more, no more Space for Repentance and working out our Salvation, and after the great Change that Death will make in our Condition, no more Changes from thence forward for ever, no intermediate Purgatory to cleanſe our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Filthineſs; but as Death leaves a Soul, ſo ſhall Judgment find it, and an <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible</hi> Sentence be paſs'd upon it. And
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:103289:219"/>this great Truth can never be too often call'd to Remembrance; and there is ſo much of <hi>Terror</hi> in it to a wicked Liver, that whoever <hi>thinks</hi> at all, muſt needs be inclin'd by it to husband <hi>well</hi> this his <hi>only</hi> Opportunity of making himſelf for ever Happy, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately endeavour to clear himſelf from that Guilt, which, if he <hi>dies</hi> in, will make him for ever miſerable, and that without the leaſt <hi>Alleviation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>laſt</hi> thing this Parable informs us of is, That every Man may be ſufficiently aſſur'd of this great Truth, that reads the Scriptures; and powerfully enough inclin'd to avoid that future Miſery, and ſecure his eternal Happineſs, without any more <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> Ways of Conviction in this Matter, or Perſwaſives to act accordingly: And that thoſe who are not ſatisfied with what has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been reveal'd of future Rewards and Puniſhments, in all Probability will <hi>never</hi> be ſatisfied, though one ſhould <hi>come from the Dead</hi> to aſſure them of it.</p>
            <p>This is expreſs'd in the Parable by the Rich Man's deſiring (after he was ſadly aſſur'd by <hi>Abraham,</hi> that there was no Remedy for <hi>himſelf</hi>) that he would <hi>ſend Lazarus to his Father's Houſe (for I have five Brethren, ſays he) that he may teſtifie unto them, leſt they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo come into this Place of Torment.</hi> To this <hi>Abraham</hi> anſwers, <hi>They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, let them hear them.</hi> But this would not ſatisfie the miſerable Rich Man, <hi>and he ſaid, nay Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>but if one
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:103289:220"/>went to them from the Dead they will repent.</hi> To this <hi>Abraham</hi> gives this final Anſwer; <hi>If they hear not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded though one aroſe from the Dead.</hi> As if he had ſaid, There is all the Aſſurance given to Men by the Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Truth of theſe things, that any <hi>reaſonable</hi> Man can deſire; and the ſame Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and Atheiſtick Infidelity and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery of Manners that makes Men disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what the <hi>Scriptures</hi> affirm of <hi>another Life,</hi> would make them <hi>ſtill</hi> disbelieve it, though one aroſe from the Dead to aſſure them of it.</p>
            <p>And if this was true <hi>before</hi> the Goſpel, when theſe things were but <hi>darkly</hi> reveal'd in compariſon of what they are <hi>now,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> might <hi>then</hi> be ſufficiently aſſur'd of them by attending to the Writings of <hi>Moſes and the Prophets;</hi> it is a much more <hi>confirm'd</hi> Truth to us Chriſtians, the Scriptures of the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament aſſuring us of it in the moſt <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>expreſs</hi> Terms that can be: Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what the Apoſtle ſays, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.8. that our Lord <hi>has brought Life and Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to light by the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet, ſome are ſo unreaſonable, as when we diſcourſe about Judgment to come, and the Rewards and Puniſhments of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Life, not to <hi>tremble</hi> at it as <hi>Foelix</hi> did, but with perverſe Infidelity, queſtion the <hi>Truth</hi> of the thing, and ask us how we can be <hi>ſure</hi> it is and ſhall be ſo, and whether we have been told it by one that <hi>came</hi> from the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:103289:220"/>other World, and has <hi>experienc'd</hi> what we ſay to be true: And that nothing leſs than ſuch a Proof ſhall ever make them believe it. And when they are urg'd with the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <hi>of</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets,</hi> and of the <hi>Son of God</hi> himſelf; they have the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to laugh at this as an Invention of <hi>Church-Men,</hi> and no better than a <hi>Religious Cheat.</hi> They are not ignorant, they ſay, that the Writings which we affirm were divinely inſpir'd, do very plainly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſſert, That there ſhall be a Judgment to come, and that every Man ſhall be rais'd from the Dead, and plac'd before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Judge, and conſign'd to eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or Miſery, according to what they have done in <hi>this</hi> Life, whether it be good or evil: But they deny the <hi>Truth</hi> of thoſe Writings, and conſequently the Reality of what they aſſert of this Nature. Our Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs therefore muſt be to prove the Truth and Divine Authority of thoſe Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and then 'twill follow, that he that ſtill disbelieves the Doctrine of future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments, and is not inclin'd to live accordingly, will neither be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd nor perſwaded in this Inſtance, though one <hi>roſe from the Dead</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Oppoſition Anti-ſcripturiſts make againſt the Holy Writings is in ſhort this. Either they will deny that thoſe Books were written by the Men whoſe Names they bear; or, if they are forc'd to grant <hi>that,</hi> they will deny the Truth of the <hi>Matters of fact</hi>
               <pb n="414" facs="tcp:103289:221"/>which they ſet down, and endeavour to pick out Inconſiſtencies and Contradictions in their Relation; and, if beaten from that Poſt, they'll deny that the Writers were Men <hi>divinely inſpired,</hi> and affirm that the Doctrine they wrote was meerly the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their own Brains, and what ſtrange Occurrences they record of their Maſter Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus (as of <hi>his</hi> Reſurrection from the Dead, as an Argument that there ſhall be another Life after this is ended, and all Men <hi>then</hi> ariſe likewiſe, and be call'd to give account of their Works) that this and the like ſtrange Paſſages they record of Jeſus, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them to be <hi>true,</hi> were not done by a <hi>Divine</hi> Power, but by Art Magick and the Power of the Devil. And this, could it be made good, would be a ſhrewd Blow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and all reveal'd Religion ſoon ſink into Ruine: But in ſhort (for to inlarge here, would far exceed the Bounds of a ſingle Sermon) a Chriſtian's Defence of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> Authority of the Holy Writings may be this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Though ſome have <hi>deny'd</hi> that the Books of the Old and New Teſtament were written by the Men whoſe Names they bear, yet no Man ever yet could <hi>prove</hi> it; nay, on the contrary, they have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd as Genuine for many Hundreds of Years, and by Men of very different Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Perſwaſions, and that were bitter Enemies to the Religion there taught, and the Profeſſors of it, and would have been extreamly glad to have prov'd the <hi>Whole a

<pb n="416" facs="tcp:103289:222"/>as well as Chriſtians; and thoſe Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſo <hi>publick,</hi> and in the Face of the <hi>World,</hi> and the Account of them was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo <hi>ſoon</hi> after they were <hi>done;</hi> that it would <hi>then</hi> have been a very eaſie Matter to have detected the Falſhood of the <hi>Whole,</hi> or of any <hi>Part</hi> of the Story, if there had been any, and both Jews and Heathens were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much <hi>concern'd</hi> to do it if they could, and no doubt, they endeavour'd it to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their Power. But yet, after all, we find that neither then nor ſince, any thing of this Nature has been faſtned upon theſe Writings, but rather the Truth of them has been approv'd by the Confeſſion of the <hi>Enemies</hi> of Chriſtianity, than which no better Argument can be produc'd for the Truth of any Ancient Hiſtory in the World.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>Contradictions</hi> and <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies,</hi> which, they ſay, are in the New Teſtament; though to Men <hi>unlearn'd,</hi> or elſe deeply <hi>prejudic'd,</hi> ſome things may at firſt ſight ſeem to claſh a little, yet upon a <hi>cloſer</hi> View of any <hi>competent</hi> and <hi>unprejudic'd</hi> Perſon, they will be found to be far from being <hi>irreclaimable:</hi> And theſe ſeeming Differences are likewiſe in things not <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial;</hi> in the <hi>main</hi> there is an unqueſtionable Harmony: Which, conſidering that <hi>four</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Men were the Writers, and that they writ in different and <hi>diſtant</hi> Places, is no mean Argument, that what they ſo <hi>punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> and <hi>agreeably</hi> relate, is <hi>true.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, thoſe <hi>little Differences</hi> that are taken
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:103289:222"/>Notice of, are rather an Argument for the <hi>Truth</hi> of their Relation, than any thing to the contrary; for had it been a <hi>pack'd</hi> Buſineſs, they would have been careful not to have differ'd in a <hi>Title.</hi> As for their <hi>laſt</hi> Reſerve, that ſuppoſing the Matter of <hi>fact</hi> to be <hi>true</hi> which they relate, yet thoſe ſtrange things that are recorded of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> might be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Art Magick</hi> and the Power of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:</hi> And that, what he or his Apoſtles have deliver'd by Way of Precept and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, was meerly the Product of their own <hi>Brains,</hi> and no Inſpiration of God: To this we may return in this Manner.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that the coming of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> into the World, was to <hi>deſtroy</hi> the Works and Kingdom of the Devil, as is evident from his caſting ſo many evil Spirits out of poſſeſs'd Perſons, and from their trembling at his Preſence, and crying out for Dread; and from his teaching ſo <hi>Holy</hi> and Heavenly a Religion, than which, nothing can more weaken his Infernal Kingdom: And to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the <hi>Truth</hi> of this his Doctrine, and that he was ſent by <hi>God</hi> to teach it to the World, he wrought diverſe and very amazing <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and thoſe highly <hi>beneficial</hi> ones too; ſuch as giving <hi>Sight</hi> to Men that were <hi>born blind,</hi> and curing long and deſperate Diſeaſes, and raiſing to Life thoſe that had been <hi>dead,</hi> and one of them four Days <hi>buried,</hi> and this only with a <hi>Word</hi> or with his <hi>Touch;</hi>

            <p>Now, can any Man in his Senſes think, that the Devil, were he <hi>able,</hi> would ſo far aſſiſt one that come on purpoſe into the World to <hi>deſtroy</hi> his Kingdom? 'Tis our Lord's own Anſwer to the fooliſhly maſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Phariſees, who, when they ſaw him work a ſtupendious Miracle upon one poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a Devil, both Blind and Dumb, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Blind and Dumb both ſpake and ſaw; objected preſently, <hi>This Fellow caſteth out Devils by</hi> Beelzebub <hi>the prince of the Devils. And Jeſus knew their Thoughts and ſaid unto them, every Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf is brought to Deſolation; and if Satan caſt out Satan, he is divided againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, How then ſhall his Kingdom ſtand?</hi> A <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration</hi> this, that 'twas not by the Power of the <hi>Devil</hi> that he wrought his Miracles, but by the Power of <hi>God.</hi> For though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded <hi>Men</hi> may be ſo fooliſh as to frame ſuch an <hi>Objection,</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> is too <hi>wiſe</hi> to put the thing in <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the other Part of what is objected, That what our Lord, and the Writers of the New Teſtament, the Evangeliſts and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, have deliver'd by Way of <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> was meerly the Product of their own Brains, and not the Inſpiration of <hi>God;</hi> I might only appeal to the Precepts and Doctrines <hi>themſelves,</hi> which are of ſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted and Heavenly a Nature, and far above any thing, that either before or ſince was ever written by <hi>Man,</hi> that they <hi>themſelves</hi> will prove their Original to be Divine.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:103289:223"/>But there is a <hi>farther</hi> Proof of this, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great <hi>Miracles</hi> that were wrought, both by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Doctrine they taught, and of their being commiſſion'd by God in an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> Manner, to declare it as the Rule of their Obedience to <hi>him,</hi> and of their Converſation in the <hi>World.</hi> For, no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Man can think, that God would have ſo <hi>wondrouſly</hi> aſſiſted <hi>thoſe</hi> above all <hi>other</hi> Men, had they not been his peculiar Meſſengers, to make known his Will to Mankind.</p>
            <p>And this, in ſhort, may be ſufficient to prove, to any reaſonable and unprejudic'd Man, the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Authority of the Holy <hi>Scriptures;</hi> and, conſequently, we have ſufficient Aſſurance, that there ſhall be another Life, when this is ended, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Men ſhall be for ever recompenc'd accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Works: For this is very plainly and expreſly aſſerted in thoſe Writings, as every Man knows that has read them. And therefore 'tis as plain, that 'tis an unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Obſtinacy,</hi> and too great Love of the ſinful Enjoyments of <hi>this</hi> World, that makes Men deny their <hi>Aſſent</hi> to ſo great a Truth, and hinders them from being inclin'd by it, to lead a more <hi>Innocent</hi> and Holy Life. And the ſame Obſtinacy and Infidel Hardneſs of Heart, and Vileneſs of Manners, would make them <hi>ſtill</hi> disbelieve that there is a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State of Eternal Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, according as Men live well or ill
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:103289:224"/>here below, and <hi>ſtill</hi> keep them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſwaded by it to Amendment, though one came to them <hi>from the Dead</hi> to aſſure them of it. For, what an eaſie Matter would it be for them to ſay, that the Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was but a <hi>melancholly Fancy,</hi> or a <hi>Dream,</hi> and regard it as if no <hi>more,</hi> and laugh at all things of that Nature, as too many now a-days are apt to do?</p>
            <p>And he that will ſhut his Eyes aganſt ſo much Reaſon, and Evidence, as there is, for the Divine Authority of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is Proof againſt any other Sort of Conviction whatever, even that of a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger ſent on purpoſe to him from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World. For ſo our Lord in the Parable, <hi>If they believe not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets</hi> (we may add, and our Saviour, his Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts and Apoſtles) <hi>neither will they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, though one aroſe from the Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, it becomes us all to be very careful, leſt the Spirit of <hi>Unbelief</hi> enter into us, and we grow ſo <hi>blinded</hi> by the Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Sin, as either not to <hi>believe,</hi> or not duly to <hi>attend</hi> to this great and ſtrongly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd</hi> Truth, of the Certainty of <hi>another</hi> Life after <hi>this;</hi> and of the eternal Rewards and Puniſhments then to be awarded to every Man according to his religious or impious Behaviour here.</p>
            <p>'Tis in vain to expect any further <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> Proof of what is <hi>already</hi> plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by him that cannot <hi>lye,</hi> in thoſe Writings which we have all the Reaſon
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:103289:224"/>in the World to believe, were written by his Divine Inſpiration. Let us rather ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſſy conſider and <hi>attend</hi> to what is there reveal'd to us, as by thoſe Terrors of the Lord relating to a future Judgment, to be perſwaded to a ſincere Reviſal of our Ways, and deep Repentance of what we ſhall find to have been amiſs, and immediate Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to do no more wickedly. Let us have a care how we are charm'd with the Pomps and Vanities of this World, as if here were our Happineſs and our Heaven, and we look'd for no other Life when this is done; and let us be chiefly employ'd in making Proviſion for that other <hi>endleſs</hi> Life which will ſucced this, that <hi>then</hi> we may be <hi>happy,</hi> when, if we are <hi>miſerable,</hi> we ſhall be <hi>always</hi> ſo. Remembring that the Rich Man in the Parable, who in <hi>this</hi> Life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd his <hi>good things,</hi> and was wholly intent upon the Enjoyment of them, and look'd no further, made no Proviſion for what was to be hereafter in that other State; aſter he died was tormented in the Flames of Hell, and <hi>wanted a Drop of Water to cool his Tongue:</hi> While the poor, deſpis'd, and ſeemingly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that begg'd for the Crumbs which fell from his Table, and was taken little Notice of by any but the Rich Man's Dogs; becauſe his Poverty made him Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and think of and provide for better things in an everlaſting World, was, when he died, conducted by <hi>Angels into</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's <hi>Boſom,</hi> that Place of Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:103289:225"/>Reſt and Peace, which is prepar'd for the Righteous.</p>
            <p>Theſe things, if we conſider throughly and ſeriouſly, there will be no need of one from the Dead, either to <hi>convince</hi> us of the <hi>Truth</hi> of them, or to <hi>perſwade</hi> us to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate <hi>Repentance,</hi> that we may eſcape that Place of Eternal <hi>Torment,</hi> reſerv'd for the <hi>obſtinately wicked,</hi> and be receiv'd into that happy State which ſhall for ever crown the pious Endeavours of the <hi>Good.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the future, <hi>may we all ſo meditate upon theſe things, and give our ſelves ſo intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them, that, through God's gracious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, our profiting may appear in all things?</hi>

                  <p>Saying, there was in a City a Judge which feared not God, neither regarded Man.</p>
                  <p>And there was a Widow in that City, and ſhe came unto him, ſaying, Avenge me of mine Adverſary.</p>
                  <p>And he would not for a while; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he ſaid within himſelf, Though I fear not God, neither regard Man;</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Force of this Parable, in order to the perſwading to a conſtant and importunate Devotion, lies in this, That if <hi>Importunity</hi> will prevail with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Man, that neither fears God, nor has any
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:103289:226"/>Compaſſion for the Miſeries of his Fellow-Creatures, to grant Petitions offer'd to him: How much <hi>more</hi> prevalent will it be, with the infinitely <hi>good God,</hi> to relieve the Neceſſities of ſuch as devoutly and earneſtly implore his Help? And to the ſame Senſe is another Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.16. <hi>Which of you ſhall have a Friend, and ſhall go to him at Midnight, and ſay unto him, Friend, lend me three Loaves, for a Friend of mine in his Journey is come unto me, and I have nothing to ſet before him; and he from within ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and ſay, Trouble me not, the Door is now ſhut, and my Children are with me in Bed, I cannot riſe and give thee. I ſay unto you, Though he will not riſe and give him becauſe he is his Friend, yet, becauſe of his Importunity, he will riſe and give him as many as he needeth.</hi> And the Application of this Parable is, <hi>Ask and it ſhall be given you, ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be open'd unto you.</hi> And the Reaſon why our Lord applies the firſt Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God's <hi>certainly avenging his Elect, which cry Day and Night to him, though he bear long with them;</hi> I ſuppoſe to be (with Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>) the great Diſcouragements his Diſciples were then under, by reaſon of the Malice of the Jews, which made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for him to keep up their Spirits by aſſuring them, that God's not <hi>immediately</hi> hearkening to their Prayers by manifeſtly appearing in their Cauſe to protect <hi>them</hi> and puniſh their <hi>Enemies,</hi> was no Argument that he <hi>wholly diſregarded</hi> them, but that if
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:103289:227"/>they perſiſted in their grateful Importunity, he would at length anſwer their Deſires. For, if Importunity be ſo prevalent even with <hi>Wicked</hi> Men, how much more will it be ſo with the God of Mercy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion?</p>
            <p>'Tis plain then, the chief Deſign of theſe Parables, though differently worded and apply'd, is to enforce the Neceſſity of <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and earneſt Prayer;</hi> and therefore, without any farther minute Explication of them, (they being ſo plain, that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>need</hi> nor will <hi>bear</hi> it) I ſhall addreſs my ſelf to diſcourſe upon what is couch'd under them, and endeavour to evince the Neceſſity of Praying <hi>frequently,</hi> and with Earneſtneſs and <hi>Importunity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Prayer,</hi> or a Liberty of making our Requeſts known unto God, is a Privilege and Happineſs ineſtimable, no one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders the Nature of <hi>God</hi> and the Nature of <hi>Man</hi> can queſtion. The <hi>latter,</hi> a poor <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent</hi> Creature, helpleſs and weak, ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted and ignorant, full of Wants and Neceſſities, obnoxious to innumerable evil Accidents, of unruly Paſſions and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Hate and Envy of the Spirits of Darkneſs, ſtrongly prone to what is Evil, and <hi>averſe</hi> to what is Good; the <hi>former,</hi> a Being of infinite <hi>Fullneſs</hi> and Perfection, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>powerful,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> the Maker of the Univerſe, whoſe is the whole Creation, and to whom, every Thing that <hi>is obeys.</hi> Now, that this indigent helpleſs
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:103289:227"/>Creature ſhould have <hi>ſuch</hi> a Patron to make his Wants known to, a Patron ſo inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtibly <hi>full,</hi> ſo <hi>wiſe,</hi> ſo <hi>able,</hi> and ſo <hi>willing,</hi> to <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>guide</hi> him, to <hi>ſupport</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> him, to <hi>protect</hi> and <hi>defend,</hi> to <hi>relieve</hi> and <hi>ſuccour</hi> him; to have Freedom of Addreſs to <hi>ſuch</hi> a Patron as this, is, without all doubt, a Privilege and Favour that no Man can ſufficiently eſteem.</p>
            <p>And yet, (ſo unaccountably ſtupid and thoughtleſs are Men for the Generality) What is more neglected, nay <hi>deſpis'd,</hi> than this invaluable Privilege! As if they were <hi>full,</hi> and had need of Nothing, or were <hi>ſelf-ſufficient,</hi> and could be their own Helpers; when indeed, they are <hi>wretched and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In pity to this our <hi>doubly</hi> Forlorn Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our Bleſſed Saviour, the God of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions, that if poſſible we might receive the full Benefit of ſo great a Favour and Divine Condeſcention; has made this <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege</hi> become our <hi>Duty,</hi> and bound it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us by the <hi>Commands</hi> of his Holy Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>encourag'd</hi> our Practice of it by his own <hi>Example,</hi> and by Himſelf and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles left ſuch Directions for the more <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual</hi> Performance of it, that every Man for the Future might be without Excuſe, if he either Pray'd <hi>not at all,</hi> or to no <hi>purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among which Directions, the <hi>Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> recommended in this Parable, and in that other before-mention'd ſo near of Kin to it, is greatly to be regarded; as that
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:103289:228"/>which will certainly, if other Requiſites are not wanting (for there are others) bring down a Bleſſing. But becauſe there are other Things requir'd both by our Lord and his Apoſtles, in order to our Praying ſucceſsfully, beſides Importunity; I think it will not be amiſs, if I diſcourſe more <hi>largely</hi> of this great and <hi>concerning</hi> Duty of Prayer, than I could do if I ſtrictly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd my ſelf to the Bounds of this Parable; and endeavour theſe three Things.</p>

<pb n="429" facs="tcp:103289:228"/>the Parables before mention'd; as if he had ſaid, God will be gracious and relieve your Neceſſities, but 'tis upon Condition you will lay your Wants before him, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his Help; according to that of S. <hi>James,</hi> chap. 4. ver. 2. <hi>Ye have not, becauſe ye ask not.</hi> In the Sixth of <hi>Matthew</hi> our Lord has ſet us a <hi>Pattern</hi> of Prayer, and commanded us to uſe it, <hi>When ye pray, ſay Our Father,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>And as our Lord, ſo his Apoſtles bind this upon us as our <hi>Duty.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 4.6. Col. 4.2. Eph. 6.18. 1 Tim. 2.8. 1 Theſ. 5.17.</note> Thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> bids us <hi>in every thing by Prayer and Supplication with Thankſgiving, to let our Requeſts be made known unto God;</hi> and to <hi>continue in Prayer,</hi> and <hi>watch in the ſame with all Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and to Pray every where, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, ceaſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duty, we ſee, is ſufficiently bound upon us by our Holy Religion: 'Tis plain and expreſs, and muſt as carefully be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd as any other Command; ſo <hi>ſollicitous</hi> is our good God for our Happineſs, as by all Means to bring us to the Practice of what will be ſo highly <hi>beneficial</hi> to us: And where the <hi>Love</hi> of a Thing, upon Account of its
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:103289:229"/>
               <hi>own Excellency,</hi> and Serviceableneſs to our <hi>Selves,</hi> will not attract our numbred ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Souls, there to <hi>goad</hi> and prick us on, and even <hi>force</hi> us to it, by Threats of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment if we refuſe. Good God! That Men ſhould need <hi>haling</hi> to Felicity! And that <hi>God</hi> ſhould be ſo deſirous of it, as thus to take all Meaſures to bring us to it! O the unaccountable <hi>Stupidity</hi> of Man, and the unſearchable Riches of the Goodneſs of God!</p>
            <p>And what a miſerable Wretch is he, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural to Himſelf, and Ungrateful to his God, who by his Obſtinacy ſhall fruſtrate ſo great Tenderneſs of God as this, and break through ſo many Obligations to his own Ruin! and with Deviliſh Pride and Sullenneſs ſtarve and famiſh his Soul, rather than Pray to God to Relieve and Help him! How many of thoſe that call Themſelves Chriſtians are thus wretchedly miſerable, God and their own Conſciences know beſt; but let not any Man be deceiv'd; 'tis not only a <hi>Privilege</hi> now, but is become a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Duty,</hi> and by the Neglect of it we ſhall not only loſe the Benefit conſequent upon the Peformance of it, but receive the Puniſhment due to the Breach of the Laws of God; which, in all probability, will be ſo much the more <hi>ſevere,</hi> as the <hi>Benefit</hi> would have been <hi>great:</hi> For nothing is more provoking, than to have great Favours and Condeſcenſions (ſuch as is this) ſlighted and deſpis'd. And thus much may ſuffice
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:103289:229"/>to prove, that Prayer is not only the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege,</hi> but the <hi>Duty</hi> of every Chriſtian. I proceed in the</p>

               <hi>Second</hi> Place, to ſhew, How <hi>far</hi> the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to this Duty does <hi>extend.</hi> Our Lord in the Proeme to this Parable, ſays, That Men ought <hi>always</hi> to pray; and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. ſays, <hi>I will that Men pray every where,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in every Place; and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, upon every Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, with every Opportunity; and 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.17. he joyns both together, and commands that we pray <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, without Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. So that 'tis a Duty that extends to all <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Places,</hi> to all <hi>Seaſons,</hi> and <hi>States</hi> and Conditions of Life; and as at all Times we ſtand in <hi>need</hi> of the Favour and Bleſſing, the Protection and Support, the Mercy and Forgiveneſs of God; ſo 'tis at all Times our Duty to beſeech it of him. But this will need a farther Explication.</p>
            <p>For this Praying without <hi>ceaſing</hi> or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, cannot be underſtood in the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Senſe, as if there were to be no Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Act,</hi> for that would be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and there are many other Things that we are as much oblig'd to, which will take up great Portions of our Time. Many Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of Nature there are that muſt be adverted to and ſupplied, many honeſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments that muſt be follow'd, many other Chriſtian Graces that muſt be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and ſometimes even innocent <hi>Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
               <pb n="432" facs="tcp:103289:230"/>muſt take place; there being, as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſays, <hi>a Time for all Things, a Time to Weep and a Time to Laugh, a Time to Mourn, and a Time to Dance. This,</hi> as well as other <hi>Affirmative</hi> Commands, does, <hi>Obligare ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> as the Schools diſtinguiſh, but not <hi>pro ſemper;</hi> that is, There is no Time, or Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or Place ſo exempt, but that in due Circumſtances we are oblig'd to this Duty, but it does not oblige as <hi>Negative</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands do, to <hi>every Moment,</hi> without any Exception. There is no Minute of our Life, but the Commands, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, Thou ſhalt not Steal,</hi> and the like, do oblige us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them; but there are very many Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Time wherein ſuch Precepts as theſe, <hi>Be Afflicted, and Mourn, and Weep,</hi> and the contrary to it, <hi>Rejoyce evermore,</hi> and <hi>Pray without ceaſing,</hi> and the like, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do nor can oblige. To keep our Minds in an habitual Frame and apt Diſpoſition for the Performance of theſe Duties in proper Circumſtances, is all that is expected from us. But more particularly, to Pray <hi>always,</hi> or every where, and without ceaſing, is to do theſe Three Things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, 'Tis to be very frequent in offering up pious <hi>Ejaculations,</hi> or ſhort <hi>mental</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as Occaſion ſhall offer, which will be very often; and the moſt uſual and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Occurrences of Life may be improv'd to this ſort of Devotion, without the leaſt Hindrance or Encroachment upon any other
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:103289:230"/>Employments. In the Field, in the Shop, in the Bed when Sleep departs, in a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, every where, and at all Times, this may be done, without Expence of Time, without <hi>Shew</hi> or Obſervation; and is a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice highly acceptable to God, and keeps the Mind in an excellent Frame and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and is out of Danger of being polluted by <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> and other baſe and little Ends; which too often mingle with our more <hi>ſet</hi> and <hi>publick</hi> Prayers. And the Soul may more <hi>vigorouſly</hi> dart forth theſe ſhort Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Breathings, and ſtorm Heaven more ſucceſsfully by theſe quick lively Efforts, than by whole Armies of Words and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of long-breath'd Petitions, which are rather apt to <hi>tire</hi> the Soul, and rebate the Edge of her Devotion.</p>
            <p>Of this Nature is the Prayer which our Lord has taught the <hi>Church;</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> far from <hi>long,</hi> and the <hi>particular</hi> Petitions very <hi>ſhort,</hi> but withall <hi>full</hi> and <hi>comprehenſive</hi> to Admiration: In Imitation whereof, have the wiſe Compilers of our Liturgy divided the Service into ſhort <hi>Collects,</hi> and compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Senſe in as few Words as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that ſo the Mind may be more <hi>intent</hi> and recollect, and have time to <hi>breath</hi> as 'twere between each of them, and return with <hi>freſh</hi> Vigour and Spirit to the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts; according to our Lord's expreſs Advice, <hi>Uſe not vain Repetitions when ye pray;</hi> and that of the Wiſe Preacher, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.2. <hi>Be not raſh with thy Mouth, and let
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:103289:231"/>not thine Heart be haſty to utter any Thing before God, for God is in Heaven, and thou upon Earth, therefore let thy Words be few.</hi> And this way of <hi>Ejaculatory</hi> Devotion comes very near to <hi>Praying without ceaſing</hi> in the ſtricteſt Senſe, and much reſembles that Heavenly Employment of thoſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Who reſt not Night and Day, ſaying Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, To Pray always, is never wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to omit the Morning, and Evening, and Noon-day Returns, of our more <hi>ſet</hi> and ſolemn private Addreſſes to the Throne of Grace; the Morning and Evening eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, which is the leaſt Homage we can pay to the Almighty, and which are Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the moſt of all in our power, to employ as we think fit.</p>
            <p>The Morning and Evening Sacrifice was conſtant among the <hi>Jews;</hi> the Fire was ever Burning upon the Altar, and never was ſuffer'd to go out. <hi>David</hi> pray'd Morning and Evening, and at Noon, and God heard his Voice; yea, ſeven Times a Day did he praiſe him becauſe of his Righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and <hi>Daniel</hi> made his Petition three Times a Day towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> Cuſtom was.</p>
            <p>The Morning and Evening are the two <hi>Extremes</hi> of the Day, and the <hi>Noon</hi> is like an <hi>intermediate</hi> Link between them, that is joyned to both, and ſo makes one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Day; ſo that, he that prays <hi>Morning</hi>
               <pb n="434" facs="tcp:103289:231"/>and <hi>Evening,</hi> and at <hi>Noon,</hi> may not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to ſpend the <hi>Day</hi> in Prayer, and to continue <hi>inſtant</hi> in it. And how ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fitting it is, that theſe Returns ſhould without any wilful Intermiſſion be obſerv'd, will ſoon appear to any one that <hi>conſiders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Firſt, As for our private <hi>Morning</hi> Devotions, our Preſervation from the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the Night paſt, God's careful watching over us while we ſlept, and lengthning out our Opportunity for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and making Proviſion for a Better Life; ought certainly to bring us upon our Knees, in humble <hi>Adoration</hi> of that Good God <hi>in whom we live, and move, and have our Beings;</hi> in humble <hi>Submiſſion to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> for the Future, and devout <hi>Oblation</hi> of our whole <hi>Selves</hi> and our whole <hi>Time,</hi> to <hi>His</hi> Service, who has continu'd to us <hi>Life, and Health, and all Things.</hi> And, ſince all our Sufficiency is of God, and we can do no good Thing, nor ſo much as think a good Thought, <hi>without</hi> him; to beg his Bleſſed Preſence with us, That he would work in us to will and to do according to his Good Pleaſure; That he would guide and protect us, and bleſs and proſper our honeſt Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and ſtill continue to watch over us for Good; That we may be undefil'd by the Temptations of the Day, and look back with Comfort upon our Actions, when we caſt up our Accounts at Night.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for our <hi>Mid-day</hi> Devotions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are then in the midſt of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:103289:232"/>and Temptations of the Day, beſet on every ſide with Allurements to do Evil; 'twill highly concern us <hi>afreſh</hi> to beg the Divine Aid and Support, that we may ſtand upright. If we have paſs'd ſecurely the former part of the Day, it becomes us to pay our humble Acknowledgments to our Divine Guardian and Guide; and if we have <hi>fallen,</hi> it becomes us with Shame and Sorrow to confeſs our Vileneſs, and depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate God's Anger, and beg his Grace, that we may be more circumſpect the <hi>Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of it. And beſides, the Works of the Creation, the wonderful Order of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, the Variety, Beauty, and Uſefulneſs of the Creatures, and the plentiful Proviſion God hath made for all our Neceſſities; will then be very proper to engage our Thoughts, and will miniſter abundant Matter for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and be very apt to fill our Breaſts with Holy Breathings and Aſpirations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that inexhauſtible Fountain of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Perfection, and Power infinite, who by his Word ſpake all this into Being.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And for Prayer at <hi>Evening,</hi> our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi> from the many evil Accidents, and the many great <hi>Bleſſings</hi> of the Day paſt; the <hi>Miſcarriages</hi> likewiſe and <hi>Failures</hi> of it, if no <hi>worſe,</hi> and the Dangers of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Night, are ſufficient Motives and Engagements to renew our devout Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the Almighty.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>private</hi> Prayer ought to be thus conſtant, and without wilful Intermiſſion;
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:103289:232"/>ſo, and more eſpecially, no Opportunity of praying to God in the publick Congregation ſhould be omitted: For, this Attendance upon the <hi>publick</hi> Worſhip of God, is that which is chiefly and primarily intended by the Apoſtles in what they wrote about this Duty of Prayer. Moſt part of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> is ſpent in giving Directions for the more decent Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>publick</hi> Service of God; and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. the Command of Praying <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>in every place,</hi> and that <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>upon every opportunity,</hi> muſt primarily relate to the <hi>publick,</hi> as any capable Perſon may perceive, by conſidering the Context.</p>
            <p>And accordingly, thoſe Converts made by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 2.42. <hi>Continu'd ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine and Fellowſhip, and in breaking Bread and in Prayers;</hi> and v. 46. <hi>They continu'd daily in the Temple with one Accord;</hi> and on the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> we find them <hi>all with one accord in one place,</hi> Acts 2.1. And thus it was in all Ages of the Church, till Iniquity abounded, and the Love of many began to wax cold. But methinks, the Conſideration of the great <hi>Advantages</hi> of theſe <hi>Publick</hi> Devotions above the Private, ſhould have ſome Influence upon us, in order to our more conſtant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance at the places of Divine Worſhip; for our Lord has expreſly promis'd his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Preſence there, and that the Prayers there offer'd ſhall be ſucceſsful. Thus <hi>Matt.</hi>
               <pb n="438" facs="tcp:103289:233"/>18.19. <hi>I ſay unto you,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that if two of you ſhall agree on Earth as touching any thing that they ſhall ask, it ſhall be done for them of my Father which is in Heaven; for where two or three are gather'd together in my Name, there am I in the midſt of them.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> is an Emblem of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Congregation</hi> of the <hi>General Aſſembly of the Firſt-born which are written there;</hi> whoſe happy Employment is, to Admire, Adore, and Extol the Infinite Mercy and Majeſty of God, for ever and ever; and as there, ſo here, the Devotion of others will raiſe our Affections, and their Zeal and Fervor quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our Devotion. To which purpoſe is that of the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24, 25. <hi>Not forſaking the Aſſembling of your ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is, but exhorting one another, and provoking to Love and Good Works,</hi> by pious Example and devout Behaviour in the Church. And the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> pronounc'd by the Miniſter at the Cloſe of thoſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Offices, was in the Primitive Times thought a Thing of no mean Regard, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever low Thoughts Men now-a-days may have of it.</p>
            <p>To this Head of <hi>Publick</hi> Prayer, may be reduc'd the Aſſembling of a <hi>Family</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to offer up their joint Petitions to God; whether by the chief of the Family, or by ſome Miniſter of Religion, if preſent: And this has been a Practice of very long ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is of excellent Uſe.</p>
            <pb n="439" facs="tcp:103289:233"/>
            <p>It keeps a Family in a ſerious Senſe of Religion; it accuſtoms Youth to it betimes, and is an excellent Example to Children and Servants, who are apt to mark and imitate their Parents and Maſters Steps more than they are aware of; and Young People will be inclin'd to think, there is ſomething more than ordinary in Religion, when they ſee thoſe, of whoſe Prudence and Experience they have an Opinion, ſo ſeriouſly ſet about it.</p>
            <p>The Returns of theſe Family-Devotions at the <hi>Beginning</hi> and <hi>Cloſe</hi> of the Day, ought not without good Reaſon to be omitted; for they naturally tend to make People more <hi>Induſtrious</hi> and <hi>Juſt</hi> in their Dealings in the World, as keeping up in their Minds a ſenſe of their being in the Sight and Preſence of a Juſt and Holy God, and to prevent Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Folly and Levity, and Looſneſs of Manners, and make the Days Sober and Honeſt, and the Nights Innocent and Chaſte. And this appears evidently to be true, in the great Difference any Man may diſcern between Families where this Holy Cuſtom <hi>is,</hi> and is <hi>not</hi> obſerv'd; Idleneſs and Lazineſs, Pilfering and Cheating, Swearing and Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Lewdneſs and Intemperance, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery of all ſorts, generally where 'tis neglected; and good Order, Modeſty, and Sobriety, Diligence and Faithfulneſs where 'tis obſerv'd: For, it tending ſo much as it evidently does, to the making Men <hi>Good Chriſtians;</hi> it conſequently, muſt needs tend
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:103289:234"/>to the making them good in every Relation.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſolemn Family Devotions, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a very good preparation for the better performance of the more publick Offices in the great Congregation. For they tend to create that habitual Seriouſneſs and Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Thought, which our <hi>Publick</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers command, and without which, we ſhall offer but the Sacrifice of Fools. The more Men are affected with the Prayers of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily at home, the more ſacred and awful will the <hi>publick</hi> Service in the Houſe of God appear to them; if attentive and devout <hi>there,</hi> much more ſo <hi>here;</hi> and the more they feel the Comfort of joint Devotions in their own Houſes, the more deſirous will they be of, and the more benefited and refreſhed by, the Harmony of a full Choir of Saints in the Holy Temple.</p>
            <p>I'm afraid this pious Cuſtom is now-a-days too much neglected; ſome grudging to take ſo much <hi>Time</hi> from their <hi>other</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments as this Duty requires; and others, on Evenings eſpecially, making themſelves <hi>unfit</hi> for the Performance of it by <hi>tarrying long at the Wine, and enflaming themſelves with Strong Drink;</hi> and ſome truly, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it too <hi>preciſe</hi> and <hi>puritanical</hi> a Thing, to be practis'd now-a-days. But theſe <hi>laſt</hi> ſhould have a Care how they throw ill Names upon what our Religion has made our <hi>Duty,</hi> and what has all along been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by the beſt Men in the World; and they would do well to conſider thoſe Words
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:103289:234"/>of our Lord, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.38. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall be aſham'd of me and of my Words in this adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſinful Generation, of him alſo ſhall the Son of Man be aſham'd, when he cometh in the Glory of his Father and of the Holy Angels.</hi>

            <p>Is it a fitting Reaſon, that a thing ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent as this ſhould be deſpis'd and diſus'd, becauſe thoſe that in other Matters diſſent from us, are ſo careful to obſerve it? Let their Piety in this Inſtance, rather ſhame us into Amendment, that we may be behind them in no Good Work, and leave them no Occaſion of Caviling and making Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt our Church, by reaſon of the careleſs <hi>indifferent</hi> Religion of ſome that are of our Communion. In particular, this Neglect of <hi>Family-Devotions</hi> is often thrown in our Teeth; and the beſt way to take off the Aſperſion, is heartily to ſet about the Practice of the Duty.</p>
            <p>'Tis our great Happineſs, were we duly ſenſible of it, that we are Members of the moſt Primitive Church in the World, and the greateſt Encouragers of True Piety and Religion; and methinks we ſhould be very careful, had we any Love for this Church, any deſire that it ſhould flouriſh and proſper, not to diſparage it by our ſo <hi>diſagreeable</hi> Converſation. Other Sects and Parties we ſee extraordinary diligent to gain Honour and Reputation, by all means, to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that their Antagoniſts may diſcover no Flaw or Indecency, no Breach of the
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:103289:235"/>Orders and Cuſtoms they have embrac'd; while we, that have the beſt <hi>Cauſe,</hi> are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the worſt <hi>Managers</hi> of it. For Shame, let us at length grow <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>live up</hi> to what we <hi>profeſs</hi> in this and every other Particular; and tranſcribe the excellent Rules of our Church, in our Converſation; let us <hi>act</hi> like true Sons of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as well as <hi>talk</hi> as ſuch; and then no Doubt but God and his Truth will prevail. <hi>We</hi> are as a City built upon a Hill, a Light ſet in an eminent Place, many envious Eyes are upon us, and rejoyce to ſee our Taper burn dim, and our City defil'd by Wickedneſs and Impurity; wherefore we ſhould be the more careful to <hi>trim</hi> our Lamps, and purge out our Stains, and ſhine brightly, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Generation: That theſe Men ſeeing our good Works, may at length glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie our Heavenly Father, by a Hearty Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Communion with us, and return to the Fold which they have ſo groundleſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted.</p>
            <p>As for ſuch as grudge <hi>Time</hi> for this Duty of praying in their Families, let them conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether they can indeed improve it more to their <hi>Advantage;</hi> whether the Gain of a little Money is to be compar'd to having the Bleſſing of God, and the Guidance and Protection of his good Providence: And whether their Time was not chiefly given them to worſhip God in, and to make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for another World.</p>
            <p>And as for ſuch as make themſelves unfit
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:103289:235"/>for this Holy Duty, by <hi>Night Revels</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,</hi> they can't but be ſenſible that that's a very ill Excuſe, ſuch as they ſhould bluſh and be aſham'd of, and a Fault which it highly concerns them ſpeedily to amend; remembring that Drunkards are in that black Liſt, of ſuch as <hi>ſhall not enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt and of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.10.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſhewn that Prayer is not only the <hi>Priviledge,</hi> but the <hi>Duty</hi> of a Chriſtian, and how <hi>far</hi> the Obligation to this Duty does <hi>extend,</hi> I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>laſt</hi> thing to be done, which is, to ſhew what is requir'd in order to the <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual</hi> Performance of this Duty; and what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. added to the <hi>Importunity</hi> recommended in the Parable we are now diſcourſing upon, will doubtleſs make our Prayers to be <hi>availing.</hi> The Apoſtles Words are theſe, <hi>I will that Men pray every where, lifting up Holy Hands with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wrath and doubting;</hi> and of theſe Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites I ſhall firſt diſcourſe, and then of <hi>Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, If we would be accepted at the Throne of Grace, we muſt lift up <hi>Holy</hi> Hands. The Word in the Original ſignifies pure and undefil'd,
<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> and 'tis an Alluſion to the Cuſtom of the Jews, who conſtantly us'd the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>waſhing</hi> before they pray'd; which was intended to ſignifie the Neceſſity of a <hi>clean Heart,</hi> in order to Acceptance with God. For God is a Being infinitely <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Holy,</hi> and that cannot behold Iniquity,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:103289:236"/>and into whoſe Preſence no <hi>unclean</hi> thing can enter; and therefore, <hi>the Sacrifice of the Wicked,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, muſt needs be <hi>an Abomination to him,</hi> and bring down a Curſe rather than a Bleſſing; and the <hi>Prayer of the Upright</hi> only <hi>his Delight.</hi> Prov. 15.8. More particularly, by this Expreſſion of lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up <hi>Holy Hands</hi> is meant theſe <hi>three</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Suppliant be one of a <hi>good Life,</hi> or if he has not formerly been ſo, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,</hi> and is ſincerely reſolv'd to live as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Goſpel of Chriſt, for the future. For how can he that is a Rebel to God, a Traytor and <hi>Judas</hi> to his Saviour, and that will obey none but the Devil and his own vile Luſts; how can ſuch an one think that God ſhould hearken to his Requeſts, who <hi>conſumes</hi> God's Bleſſings <hi>upon his Luſts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 4.3.</note> as St. <hi>James</hi> expreſſes it, and as S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Turns the <hi>Grace of God into Laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> and ſins ſtill more that <hi>Grace may ſtill abound;</hi> and is encourag'd by God's Goodneſs to perſiſt in his Wickedneſs? He only can with Reaſon expect to be heard by a <hi>Holy</hi> God, who is either actually pious and good, or heartily deſires and intends to be ſo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By lifting up Holy Hands, is meant <hi>Purity of Intention,</hi> unmix'd Deſires of advancing the Glory of God, and of the Supply of our real Needs, and of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <pb n="445" facs="tcp:103289:236"/>
            <p>That is, no Man muſt dare to play the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> in his Devotion, and have other little ſiniſter <hi>By</hi>-Ends, ſuch as the Praiſe of Men, that his Vanity may be tickled by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſteem'd more Righteous and Heavenly-minded than his Neighbours; and that under the Covert of more Religion than ordinary, he may the more ſecurely bring to paſs ſome wicked under-hand Deſign. That there have been ſuch ſort of Devotioniſts as theſe, is evident from what we find recorded of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> Men to all Appearance extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Religious, Faſting and Praying <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> and <hi>long,</hi> and very Exemplary in other Inſtances of Piety; when, after all, our Lord who knew their <hi>Hearts,</hi> has told us, they did it to be <hi>ſeen, and to have Praiſe of Men;</hi> and under Pretence of long Prayers, to inſinuate into Wealthy Widows Eſteem, that at length they might have an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to <hi>devour their Houſes.</hi> How many of this ſort there is now-a-days, God and their own Conſciences know beſt; but this is certain, that wherever the Guilt lies, 'tis a great Abomination to him, who is <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf, and infinitely hates a <hi>Lye;</hi> eſpecially in Matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> where his <hi>Honour</hi> is ſo nearly concern'd.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, let thoſe who find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves prick'd by what is now ſaid, take care that their Religion be more pure and <hi>ſincere</hi> for the Future; leſt our Lord's Woes to the Phariſees fall upon their Heads, and they be
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:103289:237"/>doom'd to the Portion of Hypocrites, <hi>where is Weeping and Gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſometimes ſignifies <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Upright,</hi> without Fraud and Cheating Arts and Oppreſſion; and he that would be heard when he prays, muſt cleanſe his Hands from theſe, muſt do as he would be done to, and <hi>provide things honeſt in the Sight of all Men;</hi> and deſpiſe the Gain of Oppreſſion, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> phraſes it, Chap. 33. Verſ. 15. <hi>For</hi> God is <hi>Juſt</hi> as well as Holy, and hates the ſly Windings of Deceit and Fraud; <hi>He is about our Path, and ſpieth out all our Ways,</hi> and will be a <hi>ſwift Witneſs againſt thoſe that oppreſs,</hi> inſtead of turning a <hi>gracious Ear</hi> to their Petitions.
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.6.</note> 
               <hi>Wherefore, let no Man go beyond or defraud his Brother in any Matter, for God is the Avenger of all ſuch;</hi> but take care that his Hands be not defil'd with <hi>unjuſt</hi> Gain, leſt it make them uncapable of receiving a Bleſſing. Thus much for the firſt Requiſite to our praying <hi>effectually,</hi> the <hi>lifting up Holy Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond is, That this be done <hi>without Wrath,</hi> that there be a Freedom from <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Revenge,</hi> and a Readineſs to <hi>Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Forgiveneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For as for a hot <hi>angry</hi> Diſpoſition, nothing more unfits a Man for Devotion than that; it makes the Mind continually in a <hi>Storm,</hi> breaks the Order and Connexion of Thoughts, puts the whole Soul into a Hurry, and makes it like <hi>a Troubled Sea that cannot reſt.</hi> And therefore, no wonder if it <hi>caſt up
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:103289:237"/>Mire and Dirt,</hi> Deſires impure and diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, rather than the ſweet ſmelling Savour of an acceptable Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>As our Religion in general, ſo Prayer in particular, is a <hi>reaſonable</hi> Service, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires as great <hi>Freedom</hi> of Thought, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected Preſence of Mind, as any thing whatever. The <hi>Object</hi> of Prayer, is a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of infinite <hi>Sanctity,</hi> and tranſcendent <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and this ſhould move us to approach him with the moſt awful and ſedate Temper of Mind; and that which is <hi>pray'd for,</hi> is, or ought to be of the greateſt Value, and which it moſt of all concerns us, to have beſtow'd upon us; and therefore it concerns us to have our Reaſon and Thoughts at <hi>Command,</hi> leſt our Petition ſhould be <hi>rejected</hi> for our ill <hi>Management</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Now, nothing more <hi>diſcompoſes</hi> the Mind, and deprives it of the Uſe of Reaſon, than the Paſſion of <hi>Anger:</hi> It puts the Spirits into ſuch a violent and unnatural Motion, as makes all the <hi>Powers</hi> of the Soul for a Time <hi>unſerviceable.</hi> Things are <hi>apprehended</hi> in ſtrange <hi>Confuſion</hi> and Diſorder, and <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred</hi> with much Imperfection, and fooliſh and ridiculous <hi>Choices</hi> are made by the <hi>Will;</hi> and all the <hi>Affections,</hi> conſequently, out of Courſe: Juſt as is the Condition of <hi>Mad</hi> Men, only the Fit is ſooner over. And is this a fitting Temper of Mind to approach the Throne of the <hi>great God</hi> in, and prefer Petitions for the greateſt Bleſſings? Let a Man, after he has been brawling with his
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:103289:238"/>Neighbours, conſider if he were to go im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to beg a Boon of his <hi>Prince,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould not <hi>then</hi> do it with great <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage;</hi> how apt he ſhould then be to commit Indecencies, and to omit Matters of chief Concern in his Requeſt, and the like; and then let him ſay what he thinks of addreſſing to the great <hi>King of Heaven</hi> in ſuch an ill <hi>Diſguiſe</hi> of Soul? And whether he does not believe that he might ſpeed much better, if his Mind were <hi>calmer</hi> and more it <hi>ſelf?</hi> Now, the Returns of <hi>Prayer</hi> being ſo frequent, and angry Mens Braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and <hi>Quarellings</hi> ſo frequent; it muſt needs often be, that ſuch Men, unleſs they <hi>omit</hi> praying, which is ſtill worſe, muſt pray to God with Minds greatly diſcompos'd, and and unfit for the Performance of ſo Holy a Duty, at leaſt with any Succeſs.</p>
            <p>As for a <hi>Revengeful</hi> Temper of Mind, that is a thing ſo <hi>contrary</hi> to him, whoſe Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Love, and who has ſo freely forgiven us ſo infinite a Debt, that no Deſires breath'd from <hi>ſuch</hi> a Soul, but muſt needs ſtink in his Noſtrils, and be utterly rejected by him. His Divine Son, the only <hi>Mediator</hi> between him and us, who preſents the Prayers of the Faithful, and intercedes for their Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; will be ſo far from appearing in an implacable revengeful Man's Behalf, that he has declar'd (in a Parable before diſcours'd of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.23.) he will deal with ſuch with the utmoſt Severity. God will accept nothing at our Hands without <hi>Charity,</hi> and a
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:103289:238"/>Gift, though brought to the Altar, muſt not be offer'd there, till he that is at Variance with his Brother be <hi>reconcil'd</hi> to him; he muſt <hi>leave his Gift before the Altar, and go his Way, and firſt be reconcil'd to his Brother, and then come and offer his Gift,</hi> Mat. 5.23, 24.</p>
            <p>A third Requiſite to our praying <hi>ſucceſsful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> is, that our Prayers be without <hi>doubting,</hi> or as 'tis expreſs'd, <hi>Heb.</hi> 22. <hi>In full Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Faith.</hi> According to what our Lord ſaid upon Occaſion of the Barren Fig-Tree's being dry'd up from the Roots at his Word, which, when St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Diſciples wondred at;
<note place="margin">Mark 11, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Jeſus anſwer'd and ſaid unto them, have Faith in God, for verily I ſay unto you, whoſoever ſhall ſay unto this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, be thou remov'd and caſt into the Sea, ſhall not doubt in his Heart, but believe that thoſe things he ſaith, ſhall come to paſs; he ſhall have whatſoever he ſaith. Therefore, I ſay unto you, what things ſoever ye deſire when ye pray, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that ye receive them, and ye ſhall have them.</hi> And elſewhere,
<note place="margin">Mark 9.23.</note> 
               <hi>All things are poſſible to him that believeth.</hi> To which agrees that of St. <hi>James, If any Man lack Wiſdom, let him ask of God; but let him ask in Faith, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wavering, for ſuch a Man ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing of the Lord,</hi> James 1. 5, 6. The meaning of all which I ſuppoſe to be this, That, as the Apoſtles, upon their firm Belief of the <hi>Truth</hi> of our Lord's <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> of enabling them to work Miracles for the Advancement of the Chriſtian Religion, and of his <hi>Power</hi> to do accordingly, ſhould,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:103289:239"/>when they pray'd for his Help, be enabl'd to do as they deſired; ſo all other Believers, if their Prayers are accompanied with a ſtrong <hi>Belief</hi> of his <hi>Veracity</hi> in promiſing to hear the Prayers of the Faithful, of his <hi>Ability</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and help them, and of his infinite <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Willingneſs</hi> to grant them their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, if it be <hi>expedient</hi> for them, they ſhall certainly ſpeed well and receive a Bleſſing at the Hand of God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>very</hi> Petitions they offer up, if for their <hi>Good,</hi> ſhall be granted them; and if <hi>not</hi> for their Good, God in his infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will beſtow ſomething elſe upon them, that ſhall be more for their Advantage: And, they may <hi>depend</hi> upon it, they ſhall not be ſent away empty.</p>
            <p>But, he that <hi>wavereth,</hi> and is of <hi>doubtful</hi> Mind in theſe Particulars, and prays with great Diffidency, and diſtruſt of prevailing; as his Prayers muſt needs be very <hi>cool,</hi> and without that Life, and Fervour, and <hi>Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunacy</hi> (which we ſhall ſee preſently is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neceſſary to our Succeſs) ſo his Mind muſt be in ſtrange <hi>Agitation,</hi> and toſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Waves of two contrary and very <hi>perplexing</hi> Paſſions, <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear;</hi> and the latter having manifeſtly the Advantage with ſuch a Man (for if his Hope were ſtronger than his Fear, he would be more fix'd and ſteady than he is) 'tis a Thouſand to one, but at length, after intollerable Diſquietudes and Anxiety of Mind, he will ſplit upon <hi>Deſpair</hi> or down-right Atheiſm. So true is that of
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:103289:239"/>St. <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 1. Verſ. 6, 8. <hi>He that wavereth, is like a Wave of the Sea, driven about and toſſed; a double minded Man is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable in all his Ways;</hi> and ſo neceſſary is it, that we ſhould firmly <hi>believe,</hi> and be actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>perſwaded</hi> when we pray, that our Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if for our Good, ſhall be granted us by our Heavenly Father.</p>
            <p>There is yet one thing more requir'd if we would <hi>ſucceed</hi> in our Devotions, and which is of very great Avail in this Matter; and that is, a Holy <hi>Earneſtneſs</hi> and <hi>Importunity:</hi> And 'tis a thing ſo much to be obſerv'd, that our Lord deliver'd two Parables (cited at the Beginning of this Diſcourſe) to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Purpoſe, <hi>That Men ought always to pray and not to faint.</hi> In both there is a Delay and <hi>Denial</hi> for a Time, but at length, the <hi>Importunate</hi> prevail.</p>
            <p>Now, though the Reaſon why our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our directs to this Importunity, cannot be the ſame with that mention'd in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; <hi>God</hi>'s Quietneſs and Happineſs being not to be diſturb'd, nor he teas'd and <hi>weari'd</hi> into Compliance, as thoſe in the Parables were, yet there may be ſeveral other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons given for it.</p>
            <p>'Tis a Manifeſtation of our earneſt Deſire of prevailing, and that we indeed <hi>highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue</hi> what we thus <hi>importunately</hi> beg for; 'tis a means to make us <hi>prize</hi> a Bleſſing the more, which we ſo <hi>hardly</hi> come by; and to be the more <hi>thankful</hi> for it when we receive it, and the more careful not to <hi>loſe</hi> or <hi>forfeit</hi> it. 'Tis
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:103289:240"/>a Tryal of our <hi>Patience,</hi> an Exerciſe of our <hi>Faith</hi> and Hope, and Dependence upon God; it teacheth <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Self-Denial,</hi> and Amendment of our <hi>Faults,</hi> leſt our Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in <hi>them</hi> render us unworthy of God's Favour; it makes Devotion burn bright and vigorouſly, and is of great Advantage to all the Purpoſes of Religion.</p>
            <p>For theſe, and ſuch like Reaſons it is, that our good God, <hi>who giveth to all Men freely, and upbraideth not,</hi> has made <hi>Importunity</hi> a Condition, in order to the obtaining our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and indeed, the Bleſſings God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages us to ask, and beſtows upon us, are ſo <hi>great,</hi> that the <hi>utmoſt</hi> Earneſtneſs, and moſt <hi>importunate</hi> Addreſſes, and the <hi>longeſt</hi> Attendance, will be abundantly repaid with a Grant at laſt.</p>
            <p>Having thus done what I at firſt propos'd to do upon the Parable of the <hi>importunate Widow,</hi> and prov'd that Prayer is not only the <hi>Privilege</hi> but the <hi>Duty</hi> of every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and ſhewn how <hi>far</hi> the Obligation to this Duty does <hi>extend,</hi> and what thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites are, which are neceſſary to the <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual</hi> Performance of this Duty, <hi>viz, Purity of Life and Manners, Sincerity of Intention, Juſt and Upright Dealing with one another,</hi> expreſs'd by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by lifting up <hi>Holy Hands;</hi> and likewiſe a quiet <hi>peaceable</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Mind, not given to <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Wrath,</hi> but apt to be <hi>reconcil'd</hi> and to <hi>forgive;</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a <hi>full Aſſurance of Faith</hi> in the <hi>Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:103289:240"/>with a Holy <hi>Earneſtneſs</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity:</hi> It remains only that we all of us be exhorted, diligently and heartily, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Meaſures before deſcrib'd, to put in Practice this ſo <hi>beneficial</hi> a Duty.</p>
            <p>There is no Place, no Time but we have need of God's Favour and Protection, and we may always, and in every Place beſeech it of him; and he has promis'd to hear and accept us, whenever we addreſs to him as we <hi>ought.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Prayer</hi> that <hi>ſanctifies</hi> Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and makes light the Burthens of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and brings a Bleſſing upon our Buſineſs and Callings, and is the greateſt Cordial up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bed of Sickneſs; wherefore, <hi>Let us pray every where, lifting up Holy Hands with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wrath and doubting;</hi> and by an <hi>Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> not to be <hi>denied,</hi> do a pleaſing Violence to Heaven; <hi>For every one that thus asketh,</hi>

<pb n="454" facs="tcp:103289:241"/>unto thee, and haſt promiſed by thy Bleſſed Son, that whatever we ask in his Name, if it be expedient for us, we ſhall receive; aſſiſt me with thy Grace ſo to advert to the All-ſufficiency and Almighty Goodneſs of thy Divine Nature, and the miſerable Indigency of my own, that I may have a due Value for this ineſtimable Favour, and be ſo much my own Friend, as often to bend my Knees before the Throne of thy Grace, and lay my Supplications before thee. I humbly confeſs, O Lord, and deplore my hitherto great and ſtupid Backwardneſs in this Heavenly and moſt beneficial Duty, and earneſtly beſeech thee, that for the time to come, thou would'ſt prepare my Soul by the Inſpirations of thy Bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that it may become a Houſe of Prayer, and a fit Habitation for thee my God. May I be frequent in pious Ejaculations, and Mental Breathings towards thee my chiefeſt Good, and conſtant in the more ſolemn Returns both of Publick and Private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion: And that I may be ſucceſsful, and my Prayers bring down a Bleſſing, Grant that I may liſt up Holy Hands to thee without Wrath or Doubting, be pure in my Intentions, careful to practiſe theſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that I pray for, and in all my Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation pious and juſt, free from all Strife, and Malice, and Revenge, and every Thing that is diſpleaſing to thee, remembring, that the Prayer of the Wicked is an Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. And may a full Aſſurance of
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:103289:241"/>Faith and Holy Importunity always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany my Addreſſes to thee, that ſo I may not be ſent empty away, but receive a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Anſwer to my Petitions, to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of my Neceſſities, and the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy Glory, through the Merits of our Bleſſed Saviour Jeſus, in whoſe Name we preſent all that we beg of thy Bounty, and hope to be heard through his prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Interceſſion. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Luke xviii. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>Jeſus ſpake this Parable unto certain which truſted in themſelves that they were Righteous, and deſpiſed others.</p>
                  <p>Two Men went up into the Temple to Pray, the one a Phariſee, the other a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican.</p>
                  <p>The Phariſee ſtood and pray'd thus with himſelf; God, I thank thee that I am not as other Men are, Extortioners, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njust, Adulterers, or even as this Publican.</p>
                  <p>I Faſt twice in the Week; I give Tithes of all that I poſſeſs.</p>
                  <p>And the Publican ſtanding afar off, would not lift up ſo much as his Eyes unto
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:103289:242"/>Heaven, but ſmote upon his Breast, ſaying, God be merciful to me a Sinner.</p>
                  <p>I tell you, this Man went down to his Houſe justified rather than the other; for every one that exalteth himſelf ſhall be abaſed; and he that humbleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall be exalted.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS Parable of our Lord's, we ſee from the Introduction and Concluſion of it, is level'd againſt <hi>Spiritual Pride;</hi> or the being highly <hi>opinionated</hi> of ones own <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and ſo puff'd up by it, as to deſpiſe others as <hi>vile profane</hi> Perſons, whoſe Religion is not with <hi>Oſtentation,</hi> and who pretend not to ſuch extraordinary Sanctity: And is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſhew, that an humble ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd Sinner, who though he has been wicked is <hi>ſenſible</hi> of it, and with Shame and Sorrow confeſſes his Guilt before God; is more acceptable in his ſight, and ſhall be ſooner pardon'd by him, and advanc'd to his Honour, than he that vaunts of his Vertue and the Performance of the External Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion. His <hi>Pride</hi> and Exaltation of himſelf ſhall <hi>abaſe</hi> him, while the others <hi>Humility</hi> ſhall <hi>exalt</hi> him.</p>
            <p>And this is very lively repreſented in this Parable, in the Perſons of a <hi>Phariſee</hi> and a <hi>Publican,</hi> and their going up into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <hi>pray.</hi> The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were a Sect among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that made the greateſt
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:103289:243"/>tenſions to <hi>extraordinary</hi> Holineſs, and <hi>ſtrict</hi> Obſervance of every <hi>Punctilio</hi> of their Law; they wore a peculiar <hi>Garb,</hi> and uſed a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſort of <hi>Gait</hi> from other Men, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons always buſied in the ſerious Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the beſt Things; they were of very <hi>reſerv'd</hi> Converſations, and of very <hi>moroſe</hi> Countenances, as greatly mortified, and Strangers to the World; their <hi>Prayers</hi> were <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>long,</hi> their <hi>Faſts ſevere and often,</hi> their <hi>Search</hi> of the Scriptures <hi>diligent,</hi> and their Contribution to the Maintenance of God's Miniſters <hi>exact</hi> and very <hi>liberal;</hi> they paid Tithes of <hi>All</hi> that they poſſeſs'd; and by this Means were highly <hi>reverenc'd</hi> by the <hi>People,</hi> and as highly <hi>conceited</hi> of <hi>Themſelves.</hi> The <hi>Publicans</hi> were Men of quite another Character and Eſtimation; they were officers that gather'd up the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Cuſtoms and Tribute, and hir'd or <hi>farm'd</hi> them of the Emperor, and then rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Eſtates to themſelves by <hi>Exaction</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion:</hi> And their Lives were ſo <hi>buſie,</hi> and ſo conſtantly taken up with ſuch <hi>vile</hi> Affairs as theſe, that they thought but little of Religion, and <hi>pretended</hi> to as little, and therefore were look'd upon by the <hi>Jews</hi> as the very worſt of Men, and call'd <hi>Sinners</hi> by way of <hi>Eminence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two ſo very <hi>different</hi> ſort of Men, <hi>went up into the Temple to pray.</hi> To ſee a <hi>Phariſee</hi> in the Temple was no Wonder, they were the greateſt Frequenters of that Holy Place, and as conſtant at Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:103289:243"/>as the Prieſts that miniſtred; but to meet a <hi>Publican</hi> there was a great Rarity: the <hi>Receipt of Cuſtom</hi> was all the Temple <hi>they</hi> generally frequented, and <hi>Mammon</hi> was the <hi>God</hi> they worſhip'd in it; and how to <hi>gripe,</hi> and over-reach, and oppreſs, was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Thoughts, and their <hi>Devotion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however <hi>unuſual</hi> it might be, yet we ſee a <hi>Publican</hi> went up into the <hi>Temple to pray;</hi> as Scandalous as his Profeſſion was, as full of Hurry and Application to the World, yet he found Time for the Exerciſe of Religion: And indeed, no <hi>lawful</hi> Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of how ill <hi>Repute</hi> ſoever, but may be very conſiſtent with a Senſe of Piety; and Men of the moſt <hi>buſie</hi> Employments, may, if they pleaſe, find time, and that <hi>daily</hi> too, <hi>to go up into the Temple to pray.</hi> And that Employment, whatever it be, and however <hi>gainful,</hi> that is a Hinderance to Religion, <hi>publick</hi> as well as <hi>private,</hi> is for that very Reaſon unlawful, and ought to be given over; <hi>For what ſhall it profit a Man, if he ſhall gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul?</hi> There are many Callings or Ways of getting a Livelihood now-a-days, which have an ill Repute, and that <hi>deſervedly,</hi> through the ill Behaviour of ſome that follow them, which yet are very Lawful, and very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in a State: And therefore, Let not thoſe that have ſuch Employments plead them in Excuſe for their <hi>Profaneneſs</hi> and <hi>Irreligion,</hi> as if their Employments were the unavoidable Occaſion of their being Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:103289:244"/>For if their Employments are neither againſt the Laws of God or Man, they may Conſcientiouſly and Religiouſly diſcharge them; and if they are upon either Account <hi>unlawful,</hi> they muſt immediately <hi>leave</hi> them, and betake themſelves to ſome other <hi>honeſt</hi> Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>The Employment of a <hi>Publican,</hi> was of <hi>all</hi> the moſt ſcandalous among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that not without Reaſon; and yet we find a <hi>Publican</hi> at <hi>Prayers</hi> as well as a <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee,</hi> and the more <hi>acceptable</hi> Suppliant of the Two: And if <hi>One,</hi> why not the <hi>whole Order</hi> if they had pleas'd? And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the <hi>Publicans</hi> came to <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> (a Perſon of the ſevereſt Sanctity) to be Baptis'd of him, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Maſter, what ſhall</hi> We <hi>do?</hi> He did not charge them immediately to <hi>leave</hi> their Profeſſion, but only, <hi>Not to exact more than was appointed them:</hi> 'Twas <hi>Exaction</hi> made their Office hateful both to God and Man, and if that were amended, the Employment was as Innocent as others. And when the <hi>Soldiers</hi> (Men generally, of all Men, the moſt Looſe and Wicked) demanded of him likewiſe, <hi>And what ſhall</hi> We <hi>do?</hi> He does not condemn their Profeſſion, but bids them do no <hi>Violence</hi> to any Man, nor Accuſe any <hi>falſly,</hi> and be <hi>content</hi> with their <hi>Wages, Luke</hi> 3.12, 13, 14. A Man that conſiders Things, would not <hi>chooſe</hi> to be of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment that carries great Temptations along with it to Wickedneſs; but if he
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:103289:244"/>were brought up to ſuch an Employment, and knows not how to ſubſiſt in any other Way, his Buſineſs is, to conſider <hi>wherein</hi> lies the greateſt Temptation and Danger of it, and arm himſelf diligently againſt that, and then he may live as Innocently, and ſerve God as Acceptably, as his Neighbours. But to live wickedly in ſuch a Calling, and then lay the Blame upon the <hi>Temptations</hi> that go along with it, is too ſlender an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe to do any Service: for if the Calling be <hi>lawful,</hi> no doubt but it may be <hi>innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> manag'd if the Man pleaſes; and if it be <hi>unlawful,</hi> he muſt for no Conſiderations whatever continue in it. And a Soldier or a <hi>Publican,</hi> for Inſtance, though of the <hi>worſt</hi> of lawful Profeſſions, yet we ſee may keep a good Conſcience, and live orderly and repent, and ſerve God as acceptably, nay, perhaps <hi>more</hi> ſo than others of higher Pretenſions; for the <hi>Publican</hi> as well as the <hi>Phariſee</hi> went up into the Temple to pray, and the <hi>Publican</hi> went away <hi>juſtified</hi> rather than the <hi>Phariſee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what was the Reaſon of that? One would think a Man of ſo <hi>great Sanctity</hi> as a <hi>Phariſee</hi> ſhould be more acceptable to God than ſo <hi>vile</hi> a Sinner as a <hi>Publican?</hi> Why, the Reaſon of this was, that the <hi>Publican,</hi> notwithſtanding the <hi>ill</hi> Character, his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> threw upon him, and the high Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> the <hi>Publican</hi> was the <hi>Better Man</hi> of the Two. The <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee,</hi> with much Pride and <hi>Self-eſteem,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:103289:245"/>high into the Temple, and then, vauntingly inſiſted in his own praiſe, <hi>I Faſt twice a Week, I give Tithes of all that I poſſeſs;</hi> and utterly devoid of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Grace of <hi>poverty of Spirit,</hi> he look'd upon his Righteouſneſs as too much his <hi>own,</hi> and uncharitably judg'd the <hi>Publican</hi> for the ſake of his Profeſſion, and then haughtily <hi>ſcorn'd</hi> him, as vile and profane in compariſon with himſelf; <hi>God, I thank thee that I am not as other Men are, or even as this</hi> Publican. He that is not ſo wicked as other Men, ought indeed <hi>to give God Thanks,</hi> for 'tis <hi>he</hi> that made him to <hi>differ;</hi> but then it ought to be with <hi>Humility,</hi> and a due Senſe of his own <hi>natural</hi> Vileneſs and propenſity to Vice, and of thoſe remaining Wickedneſſes which <hi>ſtill</hi> too eaſily beſet him; giving God all the Glory of what is <hi>good</hi> in him, and reſerving to <hi>himſelf</hi> only <hi>Shame and Confuſion of Face</hi> for the Sins which do ſtill too eaſily beſet him, and for his not making ſo good uſe of the divine Grace and Aſſiſtance as he might and ſhould have done. But there was nothing of <hi>this</hi> in the <hi>Phariſee</hi>'s Thankſgiving; 'twas only full of Pride, and Vain-glory, and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit; and that <hi>unhallow'd</hi> every Thing elſe that was Good in him, and render'd him and his Prayers abominable in the ſight of God, <hi>who reſiſteth the proud, and giveth Grace</hi> only <hi>to the humble:</hi> Such as was that <hi>Publican</hi> whom he ſo haughtily deſpis'd.</p>
            <pb n="463" facs="tcp:103289:245"/>
            <p>For <hi>he,</hi> in an humble Senſe of his former Wickedneſs, and deep Shame and Sorrow for it, ſtood <hi>afar off,</hi> as not worthy to come near the Holy Majeſty of God; <hi>and would not ſo much as lift up his polluted Eyes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> the place of perfect Holineſs and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: but, like a true <hi>ſelf-condemn'd</hi> Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>ſmote upon his Breaſt,</hi> and in bitter Remorſe of Soul ſaid, <hi>God be merciful to me a Sinner!</hi> And for this his humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence, <hi>He went down to his Houſe juſtified rather than the</hi> Phariſee; <hi>for every one that exalteth himſelf ſhall be abaſed, and he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted.</hi> A truly <hi>humble Temper of Mind</hi> is better than all the outward performances of Religion; and a penitent <hi>Publican,</hi> that is indeed <hi>poor in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> is far more eſteemed of God, than he that makes Long Prayers, and Faſts often, and Tithes all his Subſtance, and is <hi>proud</hi> of this when he has done, and <hi>deſpiſes</hi> thoſe that make not ſo much <hi>Oſtentation</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as he does. Without <hi>Humility,</hi> all is <hi>Vain-glory</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſie;</hi> and the ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moſt <hi>ſanctified</hi> Perſon that has it not, is like a <hi>painted Sepulchre,</hi> beautiful <hi>without,</hi> but full of Rottenneſs <hi>within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By what has been hitherto ſaid by Way of <hi>Comment</hi> upon this Parable, and from the Introduction and Concluſion of it (as was ſaid) 'tis very plain that 'tis deſign'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the great, nay, fundamental Grace of <hi>Spiritual Humility,</hi> or Poverty of Spirit with relation to <hi>Vertue:</hi> And to ſhew, that
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:103289:246"/>let a Man have never ſo much of Vertue or Religion, if he is <hi>proud</hi> of it, it renders all abominable in the Sight of God; and that none but the <hi>humble Soul is his Delight.</hi> In my Diſcourſe therefore upon this Parable, I ſhall endeavour <hi>three</hi> things;</p>
            <p>Firſt, To ſhew what the Grace of <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Humility</hi> is;</p>
            <p>Secondly, How <hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>beneficial</hi> a Grace it is, and how <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>miſchievous</hi> the contrary <hi>Vice</hi> is; and</p>
            <p>Thirdly, How highly this Vertue ſhall be <hi>rewarded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the firſt, What the Grace of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Humility is; I in the firſt place think in the <hi>Negative,</hi> that it can't be a thinking <hi>worſe</hi> of a Man's ſelf than he really deſerves; for no Man certainly can be oblig'd by Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be <hi>miſtaken</hi> in himſelf, it being one of the chief things that we learn in <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> as well as <hi>Ethicks,</hi> rightly to <hi>know ones ſelf:</hi> And when there is any thing in a Man that is indeed <hi>Praiſe-worthy,</hi> I can't ſee why the Man <hi>himſelf</hi> may not be ſenſible of it as well as <hi>others;</hi> and innocently <hi>pleaſe</hi> himſelf with reflecting upon it, and <hi>love</hi> what bears ſo much Reſemblance to, and is an Emanation from the Eternal Fountain of Goodneſs and Perfection. Nay, He that <hi>dwells</hi> much with himſelf, and heedfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon his Actions, and the Bent and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of his Mind, as every Man <hi>ought</hi> to do; can't be conceiv'd to be ignorant of what is <hi>good</hi> in him, any more than what is
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:103289:246"/>
               <hi>evil;</hi> and the ſame Attention which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that a Man may know his <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Miſcarriages,</hi> will likewiſe inform him of what is <hi>vertuous</hi> in him, and of <hi>good Report.</hi> And further, How can a Man be <hi>thankful</hi> to him who is the Giver of every good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Gift, for the <hi>intellectual</hi> Favours he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon him (of which <hi>Grace to live ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly</hi> is the cheif) who is not firſt conſcious that he has <hi>receiv'd</hi> the Bleſſing? The El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Revelations that took their Crowns from their Heads, and caſt them before the Throne, as an Acknowledgment from whom they had receiv'd them, firſt muſt be ſuppos'd to know that they had them <hi>on;</hi> And if there be ſuch a thing as St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls the <hi>Anſwer of a good Conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God,</hi> a Man muſt firſt be <hi>ſenſible</hi> of his good Actions, before he can feel that inward <hi>Approbation</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>I thought fit to ſay thus much in the <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> about Spiritual Humility, becauſe it has been taught by ſome that pretend to the moſt <hi>extraordinary</hi> Religion, that we ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain none but <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>abject</hi> Thoughts of our ſelves, to be conſcious of nothing that is <hi>good</hi> in us, but to call our ſelves the <hi>vileſt</hi> of <hi>Sinners,</hi> and the <hi>worſt</hi> of <hi>Men;</hi> according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Example, who calls himſelf <hi>the chief of Sinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. But ſince it cannot be true, for a ſincerely <hi>pious, ſober,</hi> and <hi>chaſte</hi> Man for Inſtance, to call himſelf the moſt <hi>prophane,</hi> the moſt <hi>intemperate</hi> and <hi>debauch'd</hi> Wretch living, for he muſt needs
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:103289:247"/>be ſenſible that is <hi>not</hi> ſo; therefore a more <hi>diſcreet</hi> Way of Humiliation and Confeſſion of our Faults ſhould be introduc'd in its Room, for nothing that is <hi>untrue</hi> can be pleaſing and acceptable unto God: And, as no Man ought to think of himſelf more <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> than he ought to think, ſo neither ſhould he untruly <hi>vilifie</hi> and <hi>miſcall</hi> himſelf, but think and ſpeak <hi>ſoberly, according as God has given to him the Meaſure of Faith.</hi> 'Tis the ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Advice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. whoſe Example is urg'd for ſo <hi>extremely</hi> debaſing a Man's ſelf in his own Eſteem; and therefore, when <hi>he</hi> ſaid of himſelf, That he was the <hi>chief of Sinners,</hi> it muſt look <hi>back</hi> to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Wickedneſs in <hi>perſecuting the Church of Chriſt,</hi> and could not be true as to his <hi>preſent</hi> Condition when he ſpoke it, for he was then a <hi>choſen Veſſel,</hi> and <hi>not inferior to any of the Apoſtles.</hi> And whatever <hi>good</hi> Man will uſe that Expreſſion after him, its Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be <hi>reſtrain'd,</hi> either with Reference to <hi>paſt</hi> Wickedneſſes, or ſome particular Vice which too eaſily beſets him; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true in its <hi>largeſt</hi> Senſe, of any <hi>ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good Man.</hi> And 'tis a ſtrange kind of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, that is made up of the Confeſſion of Faults which a Man never knew himſelf to be guilty of; which yet is much in Vogue with ſome ſort of People, but does indeed look too <hi>Stage-like</hi> to be thought real by any diſcerning Man.</p>
            <p>Poverty of Spirit therefore does not conſiſt in a Man's making himſelf <hi>worſe</hi> than he is,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:103289:247"/>(and truly there is no ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> he ſhould do ſo, every Man living having enough of <hi>real</hi> Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to humble him before God) and in <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking</hi> every thing that is <hi>commendable</hi> in him; and the <hi>Phariſee</hi> in the Parable might very <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently</hi> have <hi>thank'd God that he was not as other Men,</hi> Fornicators, Unjuſt, <hi>Adulterers, or even as a Publican;</hi> had there not been ſomething much worſe than this, mix'd with his Thankſgiving: And it was <hi>this.</hi> He was <hi>proud</hi> of his living more circumſpectly than other Men, he arrogated much of the Praiſe to <hi>himſelf,</hi> and <hi>deſpis'd</hi> one, who, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon his <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> he thought was a more looſe and careleſs Liver; and never reflected upon his <hi>Failures</hi> and <hi>Imperfections,</hi> but was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up with <hi>admiring</hi> himſelf, and vaunting of his <hi>Vertue,</hi> and did not return, as he ought to have done, <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Glory</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> So that 'tis not <hi>all</hi> thinking <hi>well</hi> of ones Converſation and Virtuous Living that is <hi>Spiritual Pride,</hi> but only when we think <hi>better</hi> of it than we <hi>ſhould</hi> do, and forget our <hi>Sins</hi> and Imperfections, or arrogantly aſcribe the <hi>Praiſe</hi> to our <hi>ſelves,</hi> not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring who made us to differ, and neglecting to return the Glory to <hi>him,</hi> and are ſo exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our own Conceits, as to deſpiſe and contemn others, becauſe their Religion is not with <hi>Shew</hi> and <hi>Oſtentation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Spiritual Humility then, as 'tis oppos'd to this <hi>Spiritual Pride,</hi> conſiſts in two things.</p>

<pb n="468" facs="tcp:103289:248"/>of them, but returning all the <hi>Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> who is the Author of every good and perfect Gift.</p>
            <p>'Tis to remember that <hi>he</hi> made us to <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi> and that we have <hi>nothing,</hi> not ſo much as a good <hi>Thought,</hi> but what we receive from <hi>him,</hi> in whoſe Divine Aid is all our Sufficiency.</p>
            <p>'Tis to reflect upon the Imperfections and Defects of even our <hi>beſt</hi> Actions, and how much Need there is of God's <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable</hi> Judgment, after we have done all that we can in his Service. 'Tis to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber likewiſe, that with ſuch great Aſſiſtances from above as we have receiv'd, we might have been much <hi>better</hi> than we are, and have practis'd <hi>more Graces</hi> of Chriſtianity, and that in <hi>higher Degrees</hi> of <hi>Perfection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when there ariſes any inward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in our Breaſts from a Vertuous Action, or we meet with any commendation from others; 'tis then immediately to give <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Glory,</hi> and transfer all the <hi>Praiſe</hi> to him, and ſuffer no vain Tumours to remain upon our Minds, nor look down with Scorn upon others that have leſs Eſteem and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the World: But rather to humble our ſelves before God at the Thoughts of the Pollutions that are ſtill upon our Souls, and reflect how great a Debt of Gratitude lies upon us to our great Benefactor, who has given us (unworthy as we are) ſuch great Meaſures of his Grace; and reſolve to make him a due <hi>return,</hi> of a daily increaſing <hi>Praiſe,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="469" facs="tcp:103289:248"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Spiritual Humility conſiſts in a due Apprehenſion of the <hi>Vileneſs</hi> of our <hi>Sins,</hi> and the great <hi>Aggravations</hi> of them; and as we muſt not <hi>overvalue</hi> our <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> nor our <hi>ſelves</hi> by Reaſon of them, ſo neither ſhould we <hi>undervalue</hi> our <hi>Vices, i. e.</hi> endeavour to <hi>palliate</hi> and <hi>excuſe</hi> them, and give them more <hi>favourable</hi> Names than they deſerve, ſuch as unavoidable <hi>Frailties,</hi> pitiable <hi>Infirmities,</hi> the Effects of <hi>Surprize,</hi> and the like: Nor think our ſelves to be <hi>leſs</hi> abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in the Sight of God for our <hi>Commiſſion</hi> of them, than indeed we are.</p>
            <p>There is no Manliving, how <hi>good</hi> ſoever, but is ſtill a <hi>Sinner;</hi> and not only Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Frailties may be laid to his Charge, but God knows, too often, Sins of a <hi>deeper</hi> Dye; as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> we know, fell into the very worſt of Wickedneſſes, though the one, otherwiſe a <hi>Man after God's own Heart;</hi> and the other an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of our Lord and Holy <hi>Martyr</hi> for his Truth Now <hi>Spiritual Humility</hi> will give a Man a due Senſe of his Spiritual <hi>Vileneſs,</hi> and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen this <hi>Sin</hi> (whatever it be) as indeed the greateſt Evil, a Violation of the higheſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and of a moſt Holy, and Juſt, and Good Law, and the very heighth of <hi>Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> too, as being a Reſiſting the Will of our greateſt <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Benefactor:</hi> And 'twill ſhew him the <hi>Aggravations</hi> of his Guilt, as being contracted againſt ſufficient Light and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and when he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Aid likewiſe from Abve to enable
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:103289:249"/>him to <hi>reſiſt</hi> the Temptations to it if he would. Theſe, and the like Conſiderations, which a Man truly <hi>humble in Spirit</hi> will call to mind, will humble him ſtill more, and render him as vile in his <hi>own</hi> Eyes as he thinks he is in <hi>God</hi>'s; and make him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate himſelf before the Throne of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty with Shame and Sorrow, and Confuſion of Face, <hi>confeſſing</hi> his Guilt, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning</hi> himſelf for it, and humbly implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> of his offended God, and that he would turn away that fierce Anger from him, which he is very ſenſible he has but too much <hi>deſerv'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>David</hi> fram'd a Pſalm on purpoſe to confeſs and bewail his great Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Matter of <hi>Uriah:</hi> He then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got all that was good in him, and did not expect that his former excellent Piety ſhould cover and make Amends for thoſe foul Sins: He did not ſearch for <hi>Excuſes,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to extenuate his Guilt; but, like a truly humble Penitent, chang'd his uſual Strain of Praiſe and <hi>Thanſgiving,</hi> for the Accents of <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Shame,</hi> and better <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, acknowledging</hi> his Tranſgreſſions, and having his Sins ever before him, and with the moſt pathetick Earneſtneſs of a <hi>broken and contrite Heart,</hi> begging God's Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that he would again <hi>Greate in him a clean Heart and renew a right Spirit within him:</hi> As if thoſe his great Wickedneſſes had not only polluted all that before was good in him, but quite <hi>deſtroy'd</hi> the Rectitude and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of his Soul.</p>
            <pb n="471" facs="tcp:103289:249"/>
            <p>And as <hi>David,</hi> ſo S. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon the great Baſeneſs of Denying his divine Maſter and Saviour, his Spirit was ſo truly humbled, that without endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring in the leaſt to conceal or palliate his Fault, <hi>he went out and wept bitterly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo the <hi>Publican</hi> in the Parable, would not ſo much as <hi>lift up his Eyes to Heaven,</hi> but ſtood <hi>afar off,</hi> in the Court of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> which was the loweſt of all, and with great Compunction of Spirit <hi>ſmote upon his Breaſt, and ſaid, God be merciful to me a Sinner!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much for the <hi>Firſt Thing</hi> to be done upon this Parable, which was, to ſhew what the Grace of <hi>Spiritual Humility</hi> is; <hi>(viz.)</hi> a not <hi>Over-valuing our ſpiritual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,</hi> nor <hi>our Selves</hi> by reaſon of them, nor <hi>deſpiſing others</hi> as <hi>leſs</hi> Holy, but return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the <hi>Glory</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> who made us to <hi>differ;</hi> nor <hi>undervaluing,</hi> or endeavouring to excuſe and <hi>extenuate</hi> our <hi>Wickedneſſes;</hi> but an impartial conſidering the <hi>Vileneſs</hi> and great <hi>Aggravations</hi> of them, and ſincere <hi>humbling</hi> our Selves for them at the Throne of God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Thing</hi> to be done is, to ſhew how <hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>beneficial</hi> this <hi>Vertue</hi> is in our Chriſtian Courſe, and how <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>miſchievous</hi> the contrary <hi>Vice</hi> is.</p>
            <p>'Tis a ſufficient Argument that this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is very excellent, and of great Benefit to Chriſtians, that our Lord has plac'd it in the <hi>Front</hi> of his <hi>Beatitudes,</hi> which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:103289:250"/>thus, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in Spirit.</hi> Like a wiſe Maſter-Builder, he lays the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>low</hi> of a Building that was to reach ſo very <hi>high;</hi> and <hi>Humbleneſs of Mind</hi> muſt be the <hi>Ground-work</hi> of that Religion which will advance a Man to <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Piety without Humility is very apt to make Men top-heavy, and over-ſet like a Ship without her Ballaſt; 'tis this that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the <hi>Soul</hi> unſhaken amidſt the <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the World, as that makes a <hi>Ship</hi> ſail <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>ſteady</hi> amidſt the <hi>mighty Billows.</hi> The Houſe in the Goſpel that was founded upon a <hi>ſandy Surface</hi> of the Earth, ſoon yielded to the Fury of the Tempeſt, and great was the Fall of it; our Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore begins with <hi>poverty of Spirit,</hi> as the <hi>Baſis</hi> and great <hi>ſecurity</hi> of all his other Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which he foreſaw and foretold was to undergo the Shock of many a furious <hi>Storm,</hi> and contend with all the Powers of the Prince of Darkneſs. But more <hi>particularly,</hi> this Grace of <hi>Spiritual Humility</hi> is ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and highly beneficial, that nothing <hi>more</hi> conduces to a Man's <hi>Spiritual growth,</hi> and Encreaſe in Vertue, nor renders him more <hi>dear</hi> both to God and Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Nothing more conduces to a Man's <hi>ſpiritual growth,</hi> and Encreaſe in Vertue. For, 'tis very true in <hi>Religion</hi> as well as in <hi>Worldly Affairs,</hi> That nothing makes Men more <hi>induſtrious</hi> than a due ſenſe of their <hi>Wants,</hi> and the <hi>poorneſs</hi> of their <hi>Stock;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, when a Man thinks he has <hi>Abundance,</hi>
               <pb n="473" facs="tcp:103289:250"/>he is generally Slothful and Careleſs, and <hi>Impoveriſhment</hi> becomes his Lot rather than a farther <hi>Improvement:</hi> An humble Senſe of a Man's <hi>Imperfections</hi> and <hi>Sins,</hi> will make him <hi>doubly diligent,</hi> and conſequently to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove</hi> greatly in the School of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but haughty <hi>Conceitedneſs</hi> will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make him grow <hi>worſe and worſe.</hi> Nay, there will be no <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>humble minded</hi> Man's Improvement; for 'tis always found in the purſuit of <hi>Vertue</hi> as well as of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> that the more <hi>real</hi> Vertue <hi>increaſes</hi> in the Soul of a Good Man, the more and greater the <hi>Defects</hi> of his Vertue appear to be, and conſequently, the more will his <hi>Diligence</hi> be quickned and ſpurr'd on; as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the farther he advanced in the Chriſtian Race, the more conſcious he grew that he had not yet apprehended what he endeavoured after, and was not yet perfect, and that made him forget what was <hi>behind,</hi> his <hi>former</hi> Attainments, and reach out to what was ſtill <hi>before,</hi> what he had not <hi>yet</hi> attain'd to, and <hi>eagerly preſs forward</hi> to the Mark, the Prize of the High Calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus. Now the Conſequence of this extraordinary <hi>Diligence</hi> muſt needs be an extraordinary <hi>growth</hi> and <hi>increaſe,</hi> and ſo ſtill <hi>onward</hi> in a quick and vigorous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till he finiſhes his Vertuous Race, and is <hi>perfect as his Father which is in Heaven is perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as this <hi>ſpiritual Humility</hi> makes a Man move <hi>ſwiftly</hi> in the Chriſtian Courſe,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:103289:251"/>ſo it makes him tread <hi>ſurely</hi> too; it ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces him, and keeps him upon his Centre, and ſecures him from thoſe dangerous <hi>Falls</hi> which too often are the Fate of the <hi>high-minded and proud;</hi> for 'twas Pride and Haughtineſs of Spirit, we know, that ruin'd the Prince of the Fallen Angels, and his Accomplices. But <hi>poverty of Spirit</hi> is the great Security of a Chriſtian againſt the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Arts of the Tempter; 'tis the proper Mark and Character of a Diſciple of the meek, lowly Jeſus; and is a diſpoſition of Mind the moſt of all apt for <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is a Grace of infinite Value, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſolutely <hi>neceſſary to Salvation;</hi> and entitles a Man, in a peculiar manner, to the Divine Aid and Aſſiſtance; <hi>for God giveth Grace to the Humble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As this <hi>ſpiritual Humility</hi> is of the greateſt <hi>Benefit</hi> to a Chriſtian, ſo does it render him highly <hi>dear</hi> both to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All Men love an <hi>humble</hi> Man, and look upon him as a Wiſe and Extraordinary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and he that is pious and circumſpect in his Converſation, and yet is not <hi>proud</hi> of it, nor deſpiſes or haughtily reflects upon others that live more at <hi>large</hi> than he does, but adviſes them better, <hi>ſeaſonably,</hi> and with <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Humility;</hi> ſuch a Man is eſteem'd as a Perſon ſent from God to do Good to Mankind, that ſeeing his Good Works mix'd with <hi>poverty of Spirit,</hi> they may be inclined to imitate ſo lovely an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and glorifie their Father which is
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:103289:251"/>in Heaven, by treading in <hi>his</hi> Steps. And as for <hi>God,</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>James,</hi> and the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of Men all agree, that <hi>he reſiſteth the proud, but giveth Grace to the humble.</hi> And <hi>our Lord</hi> himſelf, at the end of the Parable we are now conſidering, ſays expreſly, <hi>He that exalteth himſelf ſhall be abaſed, and he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted;</hi> and the <hi>humble Publican</hi> went down to his Houſe juſtified, rather than the <hi>haughty Phariſee;</hi> ſo <hi>beneficial</hi> and highly <hi>valuable,</hi> both with <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> is <hi>Humility of Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the contrary, to be <hi>opinionated</hi> and <hi>proud</hi> of ones Vertue, is a great <hi>Misfortune</hi> as well as <hi>Fault,</hi> and brings a great deal of a <hi>peculiar</hi> ſort of Trouble and Uneaſineſs along with it: 'Tis a Thing hated both by God and Men, and is deſpis'd and diſgrac'd by every Body. To what would otherwiſe be really <hi>praiſe-worthy,</hi> it brings the greateſt <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement</hi> in the World; and if a Man's Converſation be but <hi>indifferent,</hi> and like other Mens, then, nothing makes him more ridiculous, than much to <hi>value</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, upon what is of ſo little or no <hi>Excellency,</hi> And what a Pain 'tis for Men that look upon <hi>themſelves</hi> as <hi>extraordinary</hi> Perſons, to ſee others ſo <hi>far</hi> from that Opinion, as rather to <hi>ſlight</hi> and <hi>deprecate</hi> them; may eaſily be imagin'd. And indeed, 'tis the Miſhap of this ſort of People, always to meet with ſuch kind of Entertainment as this; Men ſetting themſelves on purpoſe to <hi>teaſe</hi> and <hi>worry</hi> 'em, that if poſſible, they may make them <hi>aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi>
               <pb n="476" facs="tcp:103289:252"/>and <hi>weary</hi> of a thing ſo generally <hi>hated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſides this <hi>peculiar</hi> ſort of <hi>Vexation</hi> and <hi>Uneaſineſs</hi> that attends <hi>ſpiritual Pride,</hi> there is ſomething much worſe to be ſaid of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that 'tis almoſt impoſſible for Men infected with this Vice ever to <hi>improve</hi> in Religion and grow better. For in the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Thing, nothing <hi>ſlackens</hi> Diligence and <hi>Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry</hi> more than this, without which no <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs</hi> can be made in any thing, or at beſt a very ſlow one, eſpecially where there are ſuch Difficulties to be ſtruggled with as in Religion; and what ſignifies Inſtruction or Reproof (unleſs it be to gall and enrage him) to a Man that thinks his Vertue very <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> if not <hi>compleat</hi> already? And beſides, <hi>God,</hi> from whom we derive all our Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, <hi>reſiſts the proud;</hi> and therefore, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſays, no wonder if <hi>when pride cometh then cometh deſtruction, and a haughty Spirit be the forerunner of a fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, as the Condition of Mankind is <hi>now,</hi> to be proud of <hi>Vertue</hi> is to be proud of <hi>Imperfection;</hi> for ſuch is the Vertue even of the <hi>beſt</hi> Men upon Earth: nay, 'tis to be proud of that which <hi>is not;</hi> for no Man that is <hi>proud</hi> of his Vertue is <hi>indeed</hi> Vertuous, that <hi>poverty of Spirit</hi> being wanting which gives the Value to all Religious Actions, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them acceptable in the Sight of God. And it not only pollutes and unhallows what might otherwiſe deſerve the Name of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but (as was hinted before) it keeps a Man from growing better; it <hi>blinds</hi> him, that
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:103289:252"/>he cannot diſcern his Faults; and he is ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with admiring his <hi>Excellencies,</hi> and (with the <hi>Phariſee) thanking God that he is not as other men are, Extortioners, Unjuſt, Adulterers,</hi> or the like, that his great <hi>Defects</hi> paſs unobſerv'd by him: And with the Man in the Fable, he is ſo buſie in gazing upon things <hi>above</hi> himſelf, that he perceives not the Dangers <hi>under his feet</hi> till he falls <hi>into them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus endeavour'd to ſhew what is the Grace of <hi>ſpiritual Humility,</hi> and how <hi>excellent</hi> and highly <hi>beneficial</hi> a Grace it is, and how <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>miſchievous</hi> the contrary <hi>Vice</hi> is, deſtructive of all Religion, and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful both to God and Man; I proceed now in the <hi>Laſt</hi> Place to ſhew, how highly this Vertue ſhall be <hi>rewarded;</hi> which is expreſt thus in the Cloſe of this Parable, <hi>He that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, in ſhort, Mens <hi>Humbleneſs of Mind</hi> in point of <hi>Vertue,</hi> their <hi>Self-Annihilation,</hi> and returning all the <hi>Glory</hi> of their Good Actions to God, as the <hi>Author</hi> of whatever is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in them; and without <hi>priding</hi> themſelves in their <hi>preſent</hi> Attainments, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on ſtill to <hi>greater Degrees</hi> of Perfection and Heavenly Life: This ſhall, in the World of Eternal Felicity and Glory, be rewarded with the Impreſſion of a near Reſemblance to that Divine Fountain of Holineſs and Perfection, whom here they acknowledg'd to be the Giver of every <hi>good and perfect gift.</hi> They ſhall then <hi>ſee him as he is,</hi> and they ſhall <hi>be like him;</hi> No Failures, no Slips or
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:103289:253"/>Imperfections, no Avocations from the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Employment of Admiring and Loving God, ſhall be <hi>There,</hi> which in <hi>this</hi> Life are the perpetual Clogs and Vexations of a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Soul; but with their Faculties <hi>free</hi> and <hi>vigorous,</hi> they ſhall <hi>fully</hi> enjoy this <hi>ſupreme Good,</hi> without <hi>Interruption,</hi> to all <hi>Eternity.</hi> This is that which makes a Heaven; this is to enjoy the Happineſs of <hi>God himſelf;</hi> and this Heaven and this Happineſs ſhall be the Portion of the <hi>poor in Spirit,</hi> who here aſcribe to <hi>God</hi> the Praiſe and Glory of their <hi>vertuous</hi> Actions.</p>
            <p>And their Humbling themſelves before his Majeſty, in a deep Senſe of the Vileneſs and Ingratitude of their <hi>Sins</hi> (which the beſt Man living is not wholly without) ſhall be rewarded with the <hi>Pardon</hi> of them; they ſhall be lifted up from their Proſtration at the <hi>Feet</hi> of their God and Saviour, and be received into his <hi>Boſom;</hi> and Joy, <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Joy,</hi> ſhall be in Heaven in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Holy Angels for their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. They ſhall be exalted from the State of <hi>Penitents</hi> to that of <hi>Friends,</hi> nay <hi>Sons of God,</hi> and all Tears for the Future ſhall be for ever wip'd from their Eyes, and they ſhall participate of the Joy of their Lord from Everlaſting to Everlaſting. And ſuch an Exaltation as this, is, no doubt, an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Recompenſe for all the Pains of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Mortification; and a Repentance <hi>ſo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, will never be repented of.</p>
            <pb n="479" facs="tcp:103289:253"/>
            <p>To conclude therefore; If we hope to have a ſhare in that ineffable Felicity which ſhall be the Reward of this Humility of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we have been diſcourſing of, we muſt make it our Endeavour to tread the Path that leads to it: We muſt <hi>humble</hi> our ſelves before God according to the Meaſures above deſcribed, that he may <hi>exalt us in due time.</hi> And (as without whom we can do no good Thing) we muſt with all Earneſtneſs and Importunity beg <hi>his</hi> gracious Aſſiſtance, who was <hi>meek and lowly in Heart;</hi> that we may follow his Steps, and return him all the Glory of our <hi>pious</hi> Advances, who worketh in us to will and to do of his good Pleaſure; and be ſo duly affected with Shame and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for our <hi>Wickedneſſes,</hi> as with the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican,</hi> in bitter Remorſe, and with ſincere Purpoſes of Amendment, to ſmite upon our Breaſts, and ſay, <hi>God be merciful to us miſerable Sinners.</hi>

And grant, that in an humble Senſe of my ſtill great Defects, conſidering what vaſt Aſſiſtances I have had, I may ſmite upon my Breaſt, and ſay with the <hi>Publican, God be merciful to me a miſerable Sinner.</hi> Grant this, thou meek and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lamb of God, for the ſake of thine own Tender Mercies. <hi>Amen,</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>
